<em>23 young Saharawis are imprisoned in horrific conditions in Morocco's notorious Saleh Prison, conditions which violate their human rights.</em>

<strong>Timofei Belov</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

23 Saharawi prisoners have today, December 1, been on an indefinite hunger strike for one month, bringing awareness to the plight of the Saharawi people of Western Sahara, invaded and occupied illegally by Morocco in 1975, and who have since been denied the right to a vote to determine their future. What does the world community do? Nothing.

Morocco annexed, invaded and repopulated Western Sahara against international law in 1975 and has since refused to hold a referendum on independence or autonomy. Now there are allegations that Morocco is illegally exploiting the resources of the territory it annexed.

The Moroccan Army invaded Western Sahara in 1975 when the Spanish left their North African colony and after the annexation (the Green March), the Moroccan government started repopulating it with Moroccans, diluting the native Saharawi population, trying to create an imbalance by which the Saharawi people would be in the minority in their own country. In 1991 the United Nations Organization brokered a peace treaty between the Moroccans and the Polisario Front, under which Morocco pledged to organise a referendum on self-determination.

Morocco has refused to live up to its promise and has repeatedly blocked and stalled, while it tightens its grip on the country it invaded - against every fibre of international law - and over 165.000 Saharawi refugees are forced to brave the inhospitable Algerian desert where they live in exile.

Under international law, the native population of the Western Sahara, namely the Saharawi population, should give its approval and agreement to the use of its resources by the controlling power and should benefit from these.

Local Saharawi residents have complained about their marginalization in their own country as Moroccan settlers, brought in to create an imbalance in the event of any referendum, benefit from the exploitation of fisheries and phosphates, in which Western Sahara is rich. Local Saharawi residents face an unemployment rate of 45%, while Moroccans pour in to the territory and siphon off its products. Despite all this, the European Union has signed trade agreements with Morocco, giving EU countries access to goods in transactions that do not benefit the Saharawi people.

Today 23 young Saharawis are imprisoned in horrific conditions in Morocco’s notorious Saleh Prison, conditions which violate their human rights.

Saharawi manifesto:

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17254" title="46020" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/46020.jpeg" alt="" width="200" height="150" />Again, we are forced to be the clear voice of our brothers and sisters unjustly imprisoned for their involvement in the camp of dignity Gdeim Izik of defending the universal right of any people to be free and independent.

Today marks the 30th day of the hunger strike of Sahrawis in Saleh prison in Rabat, Morocco, claiming their basic rights as citizens Sahrawis. From the platform of support for the Saharawi people we denounce the inhuman situation in which the 23 activists live, activists who have no right to sunlight, suffer from lack of ventilation plus a host of verbal and physical abuse by the occupying forces and prison staff.

These political prisoners hold merely a legitimate claim regulated by various international conventions for the protection of any prisoner. Moroccan security forces violated all international rules by not complying with the law governing prisons 98/23.

Not only political prisoners suffer in deplorable conditions, but also subjected to this inhumanity are their families who have to travel 1300 km from their homes in the occupied territories of Western Sahara to Rabat in Morocco to see them, with a maximum of 15 minutes per visit once a the week.

Since 31 October a group of human rights activists began a hunger strike to denounce the flagrant violation of human rights and their own rights as prisoners of conscience in calling for the holding of a fair trial without humiliating treatment to which they are accustomed.

Given these circumstances and unfortunately accompanied by the international community's silence, young people from different cities of Spain join together to denounce the situation in Salé prison together with the comrades of the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf for 48 hours seconding the hunger strike last October 31, 2011 for our brothers imprisoned in Saleh.

FREEDOM for Saharawi political prisoners!
SAHARA ALWAYS FREE!

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17219" title="anonymous" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/anonymous.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="262" />
<em>"We have come to take the 99%'s money back."</em>

<strong>By John Leyden </strong>

Anonymous and other hacktivists have joined together to launch an attack on banks in response to recent crackdowns against the Occupy protest movement.
<div id="body">

TeaMp0isoN and Anonymous are joining forces to run OpRobinHood, which will involve using stolen credit details to donate to charities and others, supposedly at the expense of banks.
<blockquote><strong>In regards to the recent demonstrations and protests across the globe, we are going to turn the tables on the banks. Operation Robin Hood is going to return the money to those who have been cheated by our system and most importantly to those hurt by our banks. Operation Robin Hood will take credit cards and donate to the 99% as well as various charities around the globe. The banks will be forced to reimburse the people there [<em>sic</em>] money back.</strong></blockquote>
Standard practice in cases where banks identify a fraudulent transaction is to reverse transactions and levy a chargeback – a reversal of a prior outbound transfer of funds. So while customers with compromised credit cards might not lose out, charities who receive fraudulent donations might actually end up out of pocket. TeaMp0isoN and Anonymous claim to have already taken Chase, Bank of America, and CitiBank credit cards with "big breaches across the map" and to have begun donating thousands to many protests around the world, as well as to homeless charities and other philanthropic organisations.

The hacktivists want bank account holders to withdraw their funds and deposit them in credit unions instead, something started with the legitimate Operation Cash Back scheme a few weeks ago. The hacktivists are not afraid to take on the banks, as their <a href="http://anoncentral.tumblr.com/post/13453268660/oprobinhood-teamp0ison-and-anonymous-hello-we" target="_blank">statement</a> goes on to explain.
<blockquote><strong>We are not afraid of the Police, Secret Service, or the FBI. We are going to show you banks are not safe and take our money back. We are going to hit the true evil while not harming their customers and helping others. We are not only starving the banks but are ready to start the attack. We have come to take the 99%'s money back. We are not asking permission.</strong></blockquote>
TeaMp0isoN and Anonymous previously collaborated on the OpCensorThis rap song exercise, which the former was far more active in promoting than the latter. Anonymous needs little introduction. TeaMp0isoN is another (arguably more politically militant) hactivist group that's arguably most famous for defacing the BlackBerry blog around the time of the London riots.

		<title>Left Agents of the 1%</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/frank-scott/" target="_blank">Frank Scott</a></strong>

As the Occupy Wall Street movement spread across the nation, mistakes and setbacks occurred which are minimal when compared to its success in calling attention to the private domination of America’s wealth by the upper 1% as major cause of our social problems. Agents of that minority are feverishly at work, whether directly on the payroll or simply acting according to anti-social programming that teaches individualism , selfish egoism and the divisive identity politics that reduce the 99% to splintered minorities and assure continued domination by the richest 1%.

Direct employees of corporate capital in media and politics either downgrade the movement or try to incorporate it, while some supposed progressive critics claim that only their specific problems must be on its agenda. Any attempt to bring down barriers between people and promote unity is labeled racist, sexist, exclusionary, bigoted and other expletives that play well among these agents of division.

Groups that have penetrated the gated communities of political isolation and begun to learn about each others problems and the need for unity in overcoming them are obviously seen as a major threat by the ruling powers. But less obvious are the alleged social critics who operate as a second front for the 1%, exercising their negative judgments of the movement while opting for change in the system, but only the kind which either guarantees their privileged positions in it, or assures their reputations as revolutionaries of the word, if not the deed. These servants of the 1% are often well meaning members of the working class, but just as often from the upper income levels of the 99% and quick to solve America’s problems by maintaining walls between ghettoized citizens and creating progress only for specially affirmed individuals behind those walls. In faithful service to their patrons, they help keep Americans divided , conquered and forced into thinking as minorities rather than acting as a majority.

The movement has to contend with liberals claiming alliance in order to soften its critique and bring it back into affirmative politics for corporate capital that guarantee negative outcomes for most of the 99%. These political hustlers speak out of both sides of their mouths but are exceeded by a conservative lunatic fringe which openly scrapes and bows before that wealth. Many liberals pretend to work for the nation’s majority while maintaining their jobs on the payroll of its tiniest minority while many conservatives openly grovel at the feet of wealth and unashamedly attribute all American well being to the generosity of the same earthly deities: rich capitalists.

Some left critics operate from a funky version of the more conventional ivory tower; while professing true belief in their respective subdivisions of the 99% , they insist that minorities - of all diminished labels - must flock to the defense of a democratic party owned by the 1%, because the republicans are even worse. In other words, in the American political tradition, vote for crippling polio or you may get terminal cancer, and don’t even think about a cure for the disease much less being healthy. This earns them credentials as approved radicals with tenured academic positions , best selling books and op-ed space in establishment gazettes, but they should be seen for what they are: agents of the 1%.

The liberation movement labeled Occupy Wall Street is a local manifestation of a world wide phenomenon not likely to be destroyed by overt or covert opposition, no matter its temporary setbacks. Its global status is important as political and economic crises grow more dangerous and threatening to humanity’s future. The truly radical democratic practice of Americans coming together over a common systemic problem affecting all and not simply a single issue , however serious, affecting only a few is something new and profoundly important. The call for the 99% to act as a unified majority and not allow itself to be victimized any longer by the divide and conquer politics of the 1% and its agents could not come at a more critical time.

As threats of expanding war, environmental destruction and poverty accelerate, public control over national wealth would mean a giant step towards creating peace and justice. This enrages rulers who have the power to inflict physical and mental violence through their control of weaponry and information. But social media have moved from being simple marketing devices to become democratic tools for change. They help bring human liberation closer to global fulfillment of a democratic ideal: society run by and for all the people, and not just a tiny segment of the wealthiest among them.

Agents of the 1% are desperately trying to muffle humanity’s increasing call for justice by promoting greater paranoia with irrational stories about pending nuclear violence from Iran, which has no nuclear weapons, and deafening silence about the nuclear threat presented by Israel, which has hundreds of nukes and a paranoid narrative of pending extermination to occur at any moment. The United States and NATO act as tools of the global 1% in suppression of the will of the 99% everywhere, and in signs of disintegrating sanity among the paranoid rich present themselves as spreading democracy and freedom among a global population by murdering more of its people.

Occupy Wall Street USA is part of a liberation movement to Occupy All Streets worldwide and create a whole new system , but on the way to that goal activists and supporters must be wary of agents of the 1% both in and out of established circles. They will stop at nothing to impede the move of the 99% toward democracy, from fearlessly defending the right of millionaires to become billionaires to divisively insisting their issue or group must be the center of attention, to worst of all, the insanity of not only more war, but even nuclear war.
Another world is possible and necessary but in moving forward to reach it, we also need to watch our backs in order to create it.]]></content:encoded>

KFOR: We’ll shoot; Serbs start building new road

JAGNJENICA: KFOR members used loud speakers on Tuesday to warn local Serbs that they would “shoot” if they built a new barricade at Jagnjenica. 

KFOR at Jagnjenica on Tuesday (Tanjug)The locals ignored the warning and started hauling in earth and gravel, dumping it on the road, thus constructing a new barricade. KFOR reacted by throwing tear gas at the Serbs, who are also this Tuesday building a new road nearby.

This latest maneuver by the locals left KFOR troops “partially blocked”, Tanjug is reporting. 

The vehicles the soldiers used on Monday to break up the old barricade are now located between two new road blocks, set up on both sides of the Zubin Potok-Zvečan road this afternoon. 

KFOR vehicles can at present only retreat to Čabra, an ethnic Albanian village where they had set up camp, according to this report. 

Earlier in the day, the talks between the NATO troops in Kosovo and local Serb leaders, held earlier in the day, did not produce any results. 

“If your trucks unload gravel here, we will shoot,” it was heard from the KFOR loud speakers. 

The citizens gathered on the roads reacted with dissatisfaction, but no incidents were reported from the scene. 

During the meeting on Tuesday, KFOR again asked Serbs to leave the road, while Zubin Potok Mayor Slaviša Ristić said that the troops should return to the positions they held before they moved to remove the barricade at Jagnjenica, and added that KFOR enjoyed freedom of movement. 

A KFOR commander, who reports said “did not wish to introduce himself”, accused Ristić of being “directly responsible for yesterday’s violence against KFOR” – an accusation which the mayor rejected as false. 

Ristić also said he woud call on citizens to remain calm. 

After the meeting, KFOR again used lound speakers to warn the Serbs to disperse, and threaten that tear gas would be used against them.

New road

Meantime, local Serbs have decided to build a new road near Jagnjenica. 

On Tuesday afternoon, they brought machines to the location and started building an “alternative” road, in a bid to circumvent the barricade that is now held by KFOR. 

The aim is to make sure that the town of Zubin Potok, now cut off from other towns in the north of the province, is once again connected to Zvečan and Kosovska Mitrovica. 

The citizens are hauling in gravel and building the road, while KFOR troops are observing the developments.

UN SC voices different views on Kosovo

-“KFOR and EULEX allegedly acted so as to ensure freedom of movement, but this is an shifting argument. According to the Resolution 1244, Kosovo is a special area within Serbia, and therefore we oppose the selective implementation of KFOR and EULEX’s mandate,” Churkin said.
“The use of force in order to establish the government of the so-called state of Kosovo is neither status neutral nor in keeping with their mandate,” Churkin pointed out, and added that Russia advocated a detailed investigation into developments from September 27, when KFOR used weapons and wounded civilians.
“Russia also demands that a full and objective investigation into allegations on organ trafficking be launched, under the auspices of the UN Security Council,” he said. 

NEW YORK: U.S., Great Britain, France and Germany’s representatives in the UN Security Council supported on Tuesday removal of the barricades in northern Kosovo.

Russia and China, on the other hand, backed Serbia’s integrity.

Serbia’s Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremić requested from the UN Security Council to prevent further unilateral actions. The UN Security Council permanent members strongly condemned violence but remained divided regarding who was responsible for it. 

…

Commenting on the recent incidents in northern Kosovo, the German representative said that violence against KFOR soldiers had to be fiercely condemned because attacks on KFOR…

Pointing out that putting up roadblocks was unacceptable, Wittig called on all sides to refrain from violence and asked Serbian authorities to use their influence to prevent violence. He also appealed to Priština officials to get involved in the search for a solution to the problems of organized crime and attacks on minorities. 

U.S. Ambassador to the UN Rosemary DiCarlo said that the violence in northern Kosovo had been caused by few extremists, adding that her country was still optimistic regarding solving of the issues between Belgrade and Priština. 

She called on the Serbian government to cooperate with KFOR and EULEX on removal of the barricades and arrest of suspected criminals in northern Kosovo. 

DiCarlo said that Kosovo was a unique customs market and that it therefore had the right to control its borders. She accused the Serbian security structures of being in northern Kosovo illegally. 

British Ambassador to the UN Michael Tatham strongly condemned the attacks on KFOR and called for an immediate removal of the barricades. 

He also called for continuation of the Belgrade-Priština dialogue, adding that Great Britain supported Serbia’s EU integration. 

French and German representatives voiced similar views. French Ambassador Gerard Araud said that the biggest victims of the barricades in the north were the people living there. 

The German ambassador said that the violence was organized by the Serbs who kept protesting and called for full freedom of movement in the entire Kosovo. 

He added that Serbia needed to implement the agreements that had been reached and that it was one of the conditions for the EU candidate status. 

Russian and Chinese ambassadors had completely different views regarding Kosovo, pointing out that Priština was responsible for the violence in the north. 

Russia’s Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the UN body had to send a clear message to everyone in Kosovo that they had to restrain from violence and continue the dialogue. 

Pointing out that Russia shared the concern of the Serbian foreign minister over the situation in Kosovo, Churkin reiterated that official Moscow did not recognize the unilaterally proclaimed independence of Kosovo and that this stance would not change. 

“The UNSC Resolution 1244 is in effect and represents an international and legal basis for the resolving of the Kosovo issue. We believe it is important that the dialogue is resumed, in order to find a solution to the problem,” the Russian ambassador said. 

“Unilateral actions by Priština are unacceptable,” he stressed. 

“Russia is concerned over the deterioration of the situation in northern Kosovo,” Churkin said, stressing that certain incidents were very brazen. 

When it comes to the clashes between KFOR and Kosovo Serbs, he stated it would be best if KFOR concentrated not on the removal of barricades but rather on what the concerns of the people living in that part of the province were. 

“KFOR and EULEX allegedly acted so as to ensure freedom of movement, but this is an shifting argument. According to the Resolution 1244, Kosovo is a special area within Serbia, and therefore we oppose the selective implementation of KFOR and EULEX’s mandate,” Churkin said. 

“The use of force in order to establish the government of the so-called state of Kosovo is neither status neutral nor in keeping with their mandate,” Churkin pointed out, and added that Russia advocated a detailed investigation into developments from September 27, when KFOR used weapons and wounded civilians. 

“Russia also demands that a full and objective investigation into allegations on organ trafficking be launched, under the auspices of the UN Security Council,” he said. 

“Moreover, Moscow is concerned because the key witnesses in important proceedings have been eliminated and because the number of returnees in Kosovo is unsatisfactory,” the Russian representative concluded. 

The Chinese ambassador stressed that Serbia’s integrity and territorial sovereignty needed to be respected and said that a dialogue should be a solution to the crisis. 

He expressed concern over the human organ trafficking case in Kosovo, pointing out that Beijing requested a full and an unbiased investigation. 

Colombia, Brazil, South Africa and Bosnia-Herzegovina’s representatives also stressed that the Belgrade-Priština dialogue was the only possible solution.

Senior U.S. Commander In Kosovo, Weighs In Against Serbs

U.S. Commander Condemns Attacks on Kosovo Force
By Donna Miles

-To prepare for the mission, the KFOR 15 troops trained in realistic scenarios at Camp Atterbury, Ind., and most recently, at U.S. Army Europe’s Joint Multinational Training Center in Hohenfels, Germany.

WASHINGTON: A senior U.S. military leader in Europe condemned recent violence against NATO troops in Kosovo just as a Wisconsin Army National Guard unit prepares to take command of the 15th rotation of peacekeeping forces there.

Navy Adm. Samuel J. Locklear III, commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples, visited Pristina, Kosovo, today to assess the situation a day after attacks by Serb demonstrators wounded more than two dozen NATO Kosovo Force members. No U.S. troops were wounded in the clashes.

The attacks occurred after the KFOR troops removed blockades that had shut off a main road in northern Kosovo.

“The use of violence against KFOR troops is unacceptable,” Locklear said in a statement released today…

About 180 members of the Wisconsin National Guard’s 157th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade are now preparing to assume authority for the next KFOR rotation in December. They will serve as the brigade headquarters unit for Multinational Battle Group East, also known as Task Force Falcon. In that role, the 157th will oversee operations for the entire Multinational Battle Group East.

The group includes National Guard and Reserve soldiers from Wisconsin, Mississippi, Georgia, Nebraska, Vermont, North Dakota, New Jersey, Wyoming, Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. It also includes international forces from Armenia, Greece, Poland, Turkey, Romania and the Ukraine.

To prepare for the mission, the KFOR 15 troops trained in realistic scenarios at Camp Atterbury, Ind., and most recently, at U.S. Army Europe’s Joint Multinational Training Center in Hohenfels, Germany.

…

Observer-controllers at both training sites strived to make the training as realistic as possible, he said, based on tactics, techniques and procedures taking place on the ground.

“Early on in our training, the focus was on a relatively steady state and calm environment in Kosovo,” Liethen said earlier this month at Hohenfels.

“Things have drastically changed,” he said. “It’s very obvious that the training program here at Hohenfels has been modified to replicate what is actually going on in Kosovo right now so that will definitely be a help in us conducting our mission.”

Russia Concerned Over Calls For NATO To Become Global Policeman

Moscow concerned over calls for NATO to become global cop

       
Moscow is concerned about calls by western politicians to turn NATO into a global cop.

This comes in a statement made by an official of the Russian Foreign Ministry Yuri Gorlach at an international conference in Moscow on Euro-Atlantic security architecture.

According to the diplomat, some politicians have an illusion that the world’s political problems could be settled through the use of force.

But an effective military operation does not necessarily entail settlement of internal problems in any given country. 

A reliance on military force is counterproductive and serves to exacerbate crisis situations, Yuri Gorlach said.

US involved in murder of Russian peacekeepers in S Ossetia

MOSCOW: Deputy Secretary of Russia’s Security Council Vladimir Nazarov said Russia has concrete proofs that the USA was involved in the murder of Russian peacekeepers, servicemen and citizens in South Ossetia. Nazarov said so at the international conference in Moscow on Euroatlantic security architecture on Wednesday.

“The USA was directly involved in the murder of Russian peacekeepers, servicemen and citizens in South Ossetia,” Nazarov stressed, “we have concrete proofs.”

“We’d like to remind our NATO partners about the role the alliance played in arming the Saakashvili regime, pushing it towards that war, and dragging Georgia toward NATO in 2007 and 2008,” the deputy Security Council secretary underlined.

Report: New Libyan Regime Sends 600 Troops To Fight In Syria

600 Libyans ‘already fighting in Syria’

-The Syrian government…is likely to see them as mercenaries, which NATO member Turkey allowed into their country as an alternative to a full-scale military campaign, which is impossible without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council.

The Libyan government apparently wants to share its successful experience of overthrowing the Gaddafi regime with like-minded Syrians. It has sent 600 of its troops to support local militants against the Assad regime, according to media reports.

The fighters have joined the Free Syria Army, the militant group carrying out attacks on government forces in Syria, reports the Egyptian news website Al-Ray Al-Arabi citing its sources. The report says the troops entered Syria through Turkish territory.

The alleged incursion happened with the consent of the chairman of the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) Mustafa Abdul Jalil. The NTC allegedly welcomed volunteers to join the surge.

Last Friday British media reported a secret meeting between NTC envoys and Syrian rebels had been held in Istanbul. The Libyan governing body reportedly pledged to supply arms, money and fighters to the Syrians.

Bashar Assad’s government has repeatedly accused foreign forces of smuggling armed groups and weapons into Syria and thus fueling the ongoing violence.
In mid-October the Libyan NTC was the first government to recognize the rebel Syrian National Council as the legitimate representatives of the Syrian people.

The Libyan population is in possession of many weapons, which they received during the civil war by plundering military depots, through smuggling or as aid from NATO members and countries like Qatar, which took part in the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi. The NTC has difficulties in disarming the ex-rebels, who want to keep their firearms, either for personal protection or as means to make their living.

In November, the Libyan capital, Tripoli, saw a mass protest by the rebels, who demanded that the NTC pay their wages. Some even threatened to overthrow the new government the way they did with the previous one, unless their demands are met.

Funneling armed, underemployed and eager-to-fight youngsters to another country could be a convenient move for the NTC. The Syrian government, however, is likely to see them as mercenaries, which NATO member Turkey allowed into their country as an alternative to a full-scale military campaign, which is impossible without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council.

NATO ready to take part in programme for security in Libya

MOSCOW: NATO is ready to take part in a programme for strengthening security in Libya, NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Public Diplomacy Stefanie Babst said.

Speaking at an international conference devoted to European security architecture on Wednesday, Babst said if the new Libyan government declared about the programme, which was related to strengthening security, NATO would be able to take concrete steps.

Babst also noted that NATO discussed the strengthening of cooperation with the Persian Gulf countries and the Middle East states. “Our allies would like to analyse partnership with the region. We did our work and held the corresponding consultations,” she said.

Deputy director of the Foreign Ministry Department for All European Cooperation Yuri Gorlach said Russia voiced concern over Western politicians’ calls for making NATO a “global policeman”.

Speaking at the conference, Gorlach said, “Certain Western politicians had an illusion that world political issues could be solved by military means. But a successful military operation cannot always help resolve internal issues in any country.”

“We all should react in order to help stabilise the situation in the countries. But the use of force is not effective and only slow down the dialogue and lead to internal contradictions in any country,” the Russian diplomat stressed.

For his part, head of the NATO Information Office in Moscow Robert Pszcel said the Alliance needed new approaches and ideas towards its relationship with Russia. “Of course, today we need new approaches and new ideas to develop further dialogue,” Pszcel said.

Pressure on the Syrian regime continues to intensify as do divisions among the UNSC members. Meanwhile, the UN human rights forum is expected to condemn Syria for crimes against humanity.

European and Arab diplomats have told Reuters that a UN human rights forum will on Wednesday announce an emergency session is to take place on Friday to condemn Damascus.

They also say the move is also designed to put pressure on Russia and China. Russia continues to insist on a compromise to end the crisis without any ultimatums.

It comes days after a UN commission of inquiry said Syrian security forces had committed murder, torture and rape during their crackdown on the anti-government uprising.

“This is very much being led by the Arab group. Some Arab ambassadors are at least as concerned as the European Union and United States – and possibly more,” Britain’s ambassador Peter Gooderham told Reuters.

Peter Eyre, a Middle East consultant, told RT that the Arab League is a “puppet of America and the United Nations.”

“You’ve got to understand that Cold War has never finished, the crusades have never finished,” he stated.

Eyre stresses that despite the idea of a movement uniting Islam, the Arab states have consistently turned their backs on each other in the Balkans, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Afghanistan and, most recently, in Libya.

He also underlined that further sanctions will not help Western states to end the violence in Syria.

“Obviously the people of Syria are the ultimate victims. What we have here is the tip of the iceberg of the Arab Spring which is over-influenced by the West infiltrating into Syria,” he explained.

“Sanctions are a blunt instrument which ultimately affect the population more than they affect the ruling elites,” Middle East expert Edmund Ghareeb told RT.

As the peaceful protests did not have the kind of impact that its organizers had hoped for, Syria is sliding towards a civil war, he added.

NATO Cross-Border Attacks Killed 72 Pakistani Troops, Injured 250 In Past Three Years: Army Spokesman

72 troops killed by NATO cross-border attacks in Pakistan over last three years: army spokesman

Baku: A total of 72 Pakistani troops were killed and over 250 others injured by NATO cross-border attacks in Pakistan over the last three years, said an army spokesman on Monday, APA reports quoting Xinhua.

In an interview with local media Geo TV, Major General Athar Abbas, spokesman of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a Pakistani army mouthpiece, said that the recent attacks by NATO forces on two Pakistani army checkposts in the country’s northwest tribal area of Mohmand Agency, which killed 24 Pakistani troops and injured 13 others, could lead to serious consequences.

He said that Pakistani authorities can not accept the lame excuses made by NATO forces that the attack was not deliberate or it was an act of misunderstanding.

To a question about a possible apology by NATO, the spokesman said that the apology by NATO is not enough. “We don’t accept any apology,” he said.

The ISPR spokesman denied NATO’s claim that Pakistani forces initiated the fire and said that no fire was opened from the Pakistani side and the troops retaliated only after the killing of their soldiers by the NATO attack.

He said that if NATO and ISAF were claiming that firing was started from the Pakistani side then they should present proof of the loss which they met by the firing from Pakistani troops and they should tell how many ISAF soldiers were injured or killed by the firing carried out by Pakistani troops.

According to the spokesman, when the attack was initiated, the Pakistani soldiers deployed on the checkposts immediately informed senior officers at the regional headquarters of Peshawar and main headquarters at GHQ Rawalpindi. The senior officials in army headquarters took up the issue with ISAF headquarters that an attack was being launched at Pakistani Army checkposts. They asked them to stop the firing immediately, but the NATO officials concerned did not halt the attack.

He said that after the attack reports came that 24 soldiers have been killed in the attack that continued around two hours even after the Pakistan Army informed NATO.

He said the spokesperson of NATO should explain why they continued to attack army checkposts after Pakistani officials clearly told them that their target was Pakistani troops and no terrorists were present in the area.

He said that to ensure safety and to rule out the presence of terrorists in the Mohmand Agency a large number of military checkposts were set up in the area and NATO was well aware of the presence of these posts and ISAF officials were informed whenever a new post was created so that they could have map references of these posts.

Sustained NATO Attack Was Deliberate: Pakistan Army

NATO raid was deliberate: army

* DGMO tells journalists positions of posts were already conveyed to ISAF through map references and it is impossible that they did not know these to be our posts

RAWALPINDI: The NATO attacks on border checkposts in Mohmand Agency were deliberate and were carried out in violation of coordination procedures, Director General Military Operations (DG MO), Maj Gen Ishfaq Nadeem, said on Tuesday.

Terming the strikes as unprovoked act of blatant aggression during a briefing to newsmen and defence analysts at the GHQ, Gen Nadeem said, “The positions of the posts were already conveyed to the ISAF through map references and it was impossible that they did not know these to be our posts.” Chief of General Staff, Lt General Waheed Arshad, was also present during the briefing.

The DG MO said that there were four border communication centres to coordinate operations against militants but, unfortunately, all standard operating procedures were violated by ISAF and NATO forces on the night of attack. The area where the attacks were carried out was already cleared of the militants by Pakistani forces and there was no cross-border movement of terrorists from Pakistan to Afghanistan, he added.

Prior to the incident, there had been three attacks which were carried out from across the border in 2008, 2010 and 2011, killing 14 Pakistani soldiers and injuring another 13, the senior military officer said. “No information regarding inquiry of these attacks was shared or provided to us despite our repeated requests, and when provided, it was inaccurate and incomplete,” he added. 

Giving details of the incident, Gen Nadeem said after midnight on November 26, two to three helicopters arrived in the area and engaged the border post named Volcano, breaking down all communication systems there. In response, another post, Boulder, engaged the intruding helicopters with anti-aircraft guns and other weapons. The helicopters then attacked this post.

He said all channels of coordination methods were immediately activated. “We informed them about the attack. But, the helicopters reappeared and also engaged the Boulder post.” In the attacks, 24 soldiers, including two officers, embraced martyrdom while 15 others sustained injuries, he added. When asked why did the ISAF and NATO attacked the Pakistani posts and what type of advantage they wanted to gain, Gen Nadeem said that people could better analyse the situation in the backdrop of the post-May 2 operation.

To a query, he said the response of the government was adequate and mentioned the Defence Cabinet Committee (DCC) meeting and notice to the US for vacation of the Shamsi airbase. The DG MO said the Pakistan Air Force was not asked to respond to the attack because the situation on the ground was not clear. Commenting on Afghan media reports about shelling from the Pakistani side of the border into Afghanistan, he said the reports were totally incorrect and there was no truth in them.

China: U.S. And NATO Have Trampled On International Law

US fanning terror, flouting international laws: China

* State newspaper says attack proves US will not show the slightest hesitation to violate sovereignty of another nation to ensure its ‘absolute security’

BEIJING: China’s top state newspaper on Tuesday accused the United States of flouting international law and fanning terrorism after a NATO attack killed 24 Pakistani soldiers, and it warned that the Islamabad’s grip on security could be dangerously weakened. 

The condemnation in the People’s Daily, the main newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party, kept up Beijing’s angry words in support of its partner, Pakistan, as Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has said that “business as usual” with the United States has been over after the attack on Saturday. 

NATO called the killings a “tragic, unintended incident”, and the US officials said NATO and American investigations would determine what happened in the attack in northwest Pakistan. 

But the People’s Daily said the attack already laid bare deeper problems in the US approach to militant threats. 

“Above all, we must be clear that the United States and NATO have trampled on international laws and rules,” said a commentary in the newspaper. 

“The United States and NATO have violated international law and international norms,” the paper said in an editorial condemning the attacks.

“This shows…that at crucial moments, the United States will not show the slightest hesitation to violate the sovereignty of another nation to ensure its ‘absolute security’.”

“The risk in fighting terror this way is that it will ignite latent sympathy and support for terrorism, as well as hurting many innocent people and damaging international law,” said a commentary in the Chinese-language newspaper. 

“The soil nurturing terrorism will become even more fertile, and the space for terrorism to spread even broader,” it said. 

The commentary came after the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei voiced shock over the assault, and the Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi offered Beijing’s firm support to his Pakistani counterpart, Hina Rabbani Khar. 

…

The close ties between China and Pakistan reflect…a desire to hedge against US influence across the region. 

The People’s Daily commentary said the killings of the soldiers could inflict lasting damage. 

“Islamabad’s grip on domestic security will also be weakened,” it said. “This will not only work against the war on terror, it could also leave the risk of long-term turmoil.”

Notice sent to US for vacating Shamsi: FM

ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said on Tuesday that in line with the decisions of the Defence Committee of the Cabinet, a notice has been sent to the US for vacating the Shamsi airbase within 15 days.

Terming the NATO/ISAF attack on border posts in Mohmand Agency as a breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty and violation of international law, the foreign minister said, “The time has come to review our relations.”

Talking to the state television channel, the foreign minister said Pakistan has supported the international community in the war against terrorism and has rendered great sacrifices.

She said Pakistan’s positive cooperation must be recognised at an international level and should not be taken as a weakness.

Khar said Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected at all cost.

She categorically stated that the nation and the government would not tolerate such incidents in future. “We don’t want any aid or assistance, but we want to live with dignity and honour.”

Pakistan pulls out of Afghan talks

* Cabinet decides to boycott Bonn conference in anger over Mohmand attack 

* Endorses DCC decisions to cut NATO supply and get the Shamsi airbase vacated from US

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Tuesday decided to boycott a key international conference on Afghanistan next month, widening its protest over lethal cross-border NATO strikes and exacerbating a deep crisis in US ties.

“Pakistan looks forward to the success of this conference but in view of the developments and prevailing circumstances has decided not to participate in the conference,” a government statement said. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting, which termed the attack an assault on the sovereignty of Pakistan. The cabinet gave its approval to and appreciated the decisions of the DCC to immediate close NATO/ISAF logistic supply lines and asking the US to vacate the Shamsi Airbase within fifteen days. The meeting was of the view that actions such as these attacks were contrary to the spirit of partnership and business as usual was no longer possible.

Prime Minster Yousaf Raza Gilani, who chaired the meeting, announced to summon a joint session of parliament after the recommendations of the parliamentary committee on National Security to discuss the NATO attack and the controversial memo affair. Addressing the meeting at the Punjab Governor’s House, the prime minister said there could be no compromise on Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity nor on the nation’s resolve to safeguard its frontiers.

Local Officials: NATO Helicopters Killed Three Afghan Women
Attack on Civilian Homes in Kandahar District
by Jason Ditz

At least three women were killed today and two men were wounded when NATO helicopters attacked a civilian neighborhood in Kandahar Province’s Zhari District, according to the provincial governor’s office.

NATO has so far declined comment on the attack one way or another to the press, but the governor’s spokesman said they had acknowledged the incident to their office.

The attack is the second major NATO strike on the district in as many weeks, as an attack last week on Zhari killed nine civilians, including six children.

There was no indication of any activity around the area that would be expected to lead to “air support” being called in, and the governor’s office says at least four rockets were fired at the civilian houses.

Most Russians see NATO eastward expansion as threat – poll

MOSCOW: Most Russians don’t see NATO as Russia’s partner and are convinced that the bloc’s eastward expansion is a threat to the country’s security, show the results of a poll by a state-run pollster released on Tuesday.

34 percent of respondents are convinced that the bloc is a threat to Russia’s security, down 7 percentage points from 2009. An equal number of respondents said they though the bloc is not Russia’s partner but that it poses no real threat to Russia.

Only 8 percent of respondents said NATO was Russia’s partner.

“Most of those who consider NATO a threat are supporters of the A Just Russia party (47 percent), the Communist Party of Russia (42 percent), as well as Muscovites and residents of St. Petersburg. Those who don’t see NATO as a threat are mostly residents of towns (41 percent),” the pollster said in a report.

…

The respondents who are worried about NATO expansion are mostly A Just Russia supporters (79 percent), residents of large cities (73 percent) and people of pre-retirement age or older (62-65 percent).

Those who don’t see NATO’s eastward expansion as a threat support non-parliamentary parties (26 percent) and are mostly young people.

The poll was conducted on October 22-23 among 1,600 respondents from 138 cities and towns in 46 Russian regions.

Kaliningrad radar commissioned as part of missile warning system

KALININGRAD: Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Tuesday ordered to commission the Voronezh-DM-class Kaliningrad radar as part of the missile warning system.

Medvedev, who arrived at the military unit where the radar is located, proceeded to the command quarters. Commander of the aerospace defense (VKO) troops Lt-Gen Oleg Ostapenko reported to the head of state about the radar’s readiness to go on line, and Medvedev issued the order to add the facility to the VKO assets.

…

Medvedev said he would chair a conference later in the day with the leadership of the armed forces within the framework of the instructions he had issued last week in connection with the situation involving U.S. missile defense facilities in Europe.

The Kaliningrad radar went on line ahead of schedule after the Russian president’s statement.

Radars of this class are Russian factory-assembled over-the-horizon, long-range warning facilities…

In addition, Voronezh-DM functions in decimal waveband, which provides for higher accuracy. Its energy consumption is lower by 40 percent, and it utilizes less equipment than previous models. The range of Voronezh-dm reaches 6,000 kilometers.

At present, similar facilities are on experimental and combat duty in Armavir and the Leningrad region (village of Lekhtusi). In 2012, another Vornozeh-DM radar will be commissioned in the Irkutsk region.

The Kaliningrad radar was built to improve the missile warning system in Russia’s northeastern air/space direction and covers the western sector, which was monitored by the stations in Mukachyovo and Baranovichi in Soviet times.

“It considerably expands the range of information tasks for subsequent decision-making by our country’s top leadership,” VKO troops commander Lt-Gen Oleg Ostapenko noted in this connection on November 25.

The Russian Defense Ministry plans to replace all Russian long-range radars with Voronezh-DM facilities and build several new ones. Using these radars, Russia will fully restore its monitoring of airspace in its territory and far beyond.

Russia activates missile warning system in Kaliningrad

MOSCOW: Russia has activated a radar warning system in Kaliningrad in response to a planned U.S. missile shield in Europe, Russian news agencies reported Tuesday.

“I expect that this step will be seen by our partners as the first signal of the readiness of our country to make an adequate response” to the U.S. shield, President Dmitry Medvedev told senior defense officials in Kaliningrad.

Russia is ready to listen to Western partners’ proposals on the missile defense issues, Medvedev said.

“If other steps are taken, we will naturally be prepared to listen,” he said, but “in any case only verbal statements will not suffice.”

Medvedev said last week that Russia might station missile defense systems, including the Iskander, in western and southern sections of the country if there were any additional U.S. missile deployments in Europe.

Moscow has long opposed the deployment of U.S.-led NATO missile defense facilities near its borders. It wants legally binding guarantees from the United States and NATO that the missile defense shield is not targeting Russia.

Russia launches new missile defense to cover Atlantic

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered operational the newest Russian radar system that protects from missile attacks and covers all Europe and Atlantic.

Medvedev personally arrived in Russia’s westernmost exclave of Kaliningrad and received a report from the Space Defense Troops commander that the radar station was fully ready for the launch. After this, the president gave the order to put the radar on combat duty.

At the ceremony Medvedev said that the radar launch was a sign to the Western partners that Russia was ready to promptly respond to threats that arise with the start of the European missile defense. “I expect that this step will be regarded by Western partners as the first signal of our country’s readiness to appropriately respond to the threats posed by the missile defense system to our strategic nuclear forces,” the Russian President said.

After the launch the president held a conference with top commanders of the Russian Military Forces. There he said that Russia was ready to listen to proposals on missile defense, but repeated that “verbal statements alone will not suffice.”

“If our signal is not heard, as I said on November 23 we will deploy other means of defense, including approving harsh counter-measures and the deployment of a strike group,” Medvedev said. “If other steps are taken, we are ready to listen to them, but in any case, verbal statements alone will not suffice,” the president said. 

“When they tell us ‘this is not meant against you,’ I would like to say the following today – dear friends, this radar station that started its work today is also not meant against you. But it is meant for us and for the tasks that we set before us,” Medvedev said.

The Voronezh-DM station has been working in test mode for the whole of 2011. There were no technical failures over this period, Interfax news agency reported, quoting a source in the Defense Ministry. The source also said that the Kaliningrad station will be the third of its kind, with the first two already working in Leningrad and Krasnodar Regions.

With the effective detection range of 6,000 kilometers, the Voronezh-DM is processing the reports of missile strikes on military and civilian combat posts. The station is capable of working in connection with Moscow’s missile defense system.

The commander of the Russian Space Defense Troops, Lieutenant-General Oleg Ostapenko has said earlier that the new station in Kaliningrad would allow control of the entire European and Atlantic regions.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev last week said that Russia would strengthen its defenses and deploy missiles and anti-missile components to Kaliningrad as a reply to the US and NATO constant push towards creating the European Missile Defense system with components stationed near the Russian border.

Russia opposes the program, saying it threatens the balance of nuclear forces and demands legally-binding guarantees that the system will not be used against it. The Western side says the new missile defense it built against the threat from rogue states, but so far provided no such guarantees to Russia.

Kaliningrad Radar A Signal To The West

Kaliningrad radar a signal to the West
Svetlana Andreyeva

       
A long-range anti-missile radar has been put on combat duty in Russia’s northwestern region of Kaliningrad.

President Dmitry Medvedev, who personally inaugurated the Kaliningrad radar on Tuesday, said that its key task was to provide early warning of possible missile attacks and to protect national security in the most missile-dangerous directions. He did not rule out the possibility of integrating the Kaliningrad radar into a joint Russian-NATO missile defense shield in the future but complained that Western partners were reluctant to cooperate in this sphere.

The Voronezh-DM radar in Kaliningrad is a signal to the West that Russia will respond adequately to potential threats emanating from the U.S. anti-missile system in Europe, President Medvedev said:

“The Voronezh-DM radar is an instrument of aerospace control. It does not pose any threat to our neighbors. Its creation does not shut the door to dialogue on the issues we have been discussing with our colleagues. Its capabilities allow it to be used in the interests of a common European missile defense system. But this will depend on the ultimate approaches we expect NATO, the United States and European partners to formulate. The usual statements that the system of a phased and adaptive transition to European missile defense, which is currently being created, is not directed against Russia no longer suits us. Unfortunately, verbal assurances do not guarantee the protection of our interests. If other proposals are put forward, naturally we are ready to listen to them. But verbal statements are not enough. The radar that was put into operation today is not against you – it is for you and for addressing the tasks we are setting ourselves.”

The up-to-date decimeter-band Kaliningrad radar will carry out aerospace surveillance across a vast territory from the North Pole to North Africa. It is capable of tracking a target at a distance of 6,000 km and consumes 40% less power than its predecessors. Another of its advantages is that it is easily movable and rapidly assembled. 

The Kaliningrad radar is the first of the counter-measures announced by President Medvedev on November 23 in response to the unilateral deployment of the U.S. missile defense shield in Europe.

Myanmar: U.S. Intensifies Isolation, Encirclement Of China

China-Myanmar ties challenged by US moves
By Li Xiguang 

-Myanmar ports would be able to shorten the distance between Western China and the Indian Ocean by 3,000 kilometers by not passing through the Strait of Malacca and the ports in Shanghai and Hong Kong.
Myanmar is also looked as a crucial alternative route in China’s long-term goal of securing a safe conduit of its much-needed fuel from Middle East and Africa.
-In the worst case crisis scenario in China-US relations, a blockade of the Chinese coast and the Malacca Strait could be the cards the US is most likely to play. In late September, Myanmar made a surprising announcement that it would halt the construction of the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydropower station invested by a Chinese company. 

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s visit to Myanmar, starting today, will further unnerve China, which has recently been increasingly worried that the aim of the new US Asian policy is to isolate and encircle China.

Historically and geographically, Myanmar has been a close neighbor to China. For centuries, the two countries have enjoyed a family tie known as “pauk-phaw (brotherhood)” in Myanmese because of intermarriage between border inhabitants.

China’s former premier Zhou Enlai visited Myanmar nine times while his counterpart, Myanmar leader Ne Win visited China 12 times. During Zhou’s first visit to Myanmar in 1954, the two countries stressed the five principles of peaceful coexistence in international relations. The five principles are still the foundation of China’s handling of international relations today. 

For centuries, the two peoples have traveled freely across the border on dirt roads and forested mountains. Chinese late foreign minister Marshal Chen Yi composed a poem which reads, “I (China) am upstream and you (Myanmar) are downstream. We share water from the same river with friendship.”

Today, Myanmar is the pivot of China’s grand strategy to achieve its economic growth goal.

The development of Western China depends on a secured shorter trade and fuel routes to the ocean. Close to the key shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia, Myanmar is important for China to develop its southwestern inland provinces, which have a population of about 200 million people. 

These backward provinces want to trade with the growing economies of Southeast Asia, India, the Arab world and Europe. Chinese academics and the government have been discussing using Myanmar as a bridge to revive the legendary “Southwest Silk Road” from Yunnan and Sichuan Provinces to Myanmar and westward to India, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. 

Myanmar ports would be able to shorten the distance between Western China and the Indian Ocean by 3,000 kilometers by not passing through the Strait of Malacca and the ports in Shanghai and Hong Kong. 

Myanmar is also looked as a crucial alternative route in China’s long-term goal of securing a safe conduit of its much-needed fuel from Middle East and Africa. 

China in recent decades has been constructing an oil pipeline and highway in Myanmar to obtain access to a port by the Indian Ocean. With the 2,000-kilometer Myanmar-Yunnan-Chongqing oil pipeline, China has now almost secured an outlet to the Indian Ocean for its landlocked southwestern provinces.

But recently, this route appears to be under increasing uncertainty. As early as 2010, Clinton declared that the South China Sea was vital to US interests. In September of this year, Clinton announced a new US policy in South Asia of building a new Silk Road bypassing China. In the November issue of Foreign Policy magazine, Clinton published a lengthy article in which she declared the coming of the US’s Pacific Century. And two weeks later, at a forum in Honolulu, Obama announced that “The US is a Pacific power and we’re here to stay.” 

In the worst case crisis scenario in China-US relations, a blockade of the Chinese coast and the Malacca Strait could be the cards the US is most likely to play. In late September, Myanmar made a surprising announcement that it would halt the construction of the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydropower station invested by a Chinese company. 

A month later, Clinton announced that she would visit Myanmar, perhaps as a kind of reward to the country’s new leadership. Chinese media speculate that the US government was behind the Myanmar decision to halt the dam.

Obama and Clinton’s latest moves to isolate and encircle China have made the country more eager than ever to vary its routes for transporting fuel from the Middle East and Africa. China cannot afford to lose the Myanmar route.

Canada To Complete High Arctic Military Center

Ottawa moves ahead with High Arctic military centre
The new military facility will be built on to the existing Polar Continental Shelf Project research base in Resolute, Nunavut. It is scheduled to be complete by 2013

The federal government will move ahead with its planned military facility in Resolute, Nunavut.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper promised an Arctic warfare training facility in 2007. The facility looks like it will now become reality, but with a few changes to the original plan.

…

[The Department of National Defence's Major Bill Chambré said] “My focus is mainly building a training facility but to also have a facility where we can conduct operations.”

The facility will be built on to the existing Polar Continental Shelf Project research base, which is already the largest in the community.

…

The building’s price tag is $18 million and the final design is expected to be complete by next month.

Chambré insists it is not the permanent search and rescue base northerners have called for because it’s unlikely the military will use the facility year round.

The government plans to work out of the facility mostly during winter, with people from other government departments working there mainly in summer.

“I certainly don’t see this going idle, especially when we have two government departments sharing,” said Chambré.

Building materials will arrive in Resolute on the next sealift, and construction is scheduled to be complete by 2013.

50 Per Cent Export Increase Last Year: Germany Now Major Middle East Arms Supplier

http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2011/11/29/Germany-now-major-Mideast-arms-supplier/UPI-38651322594985/

Germany now major Mideast arms supplier

BEIRUT, Lebanon: The German government is under fire for its $2 billion sale of 270 Leopard 2 tanks to Saudi Arabia but the fact is that Germany is now a key arms supplier to the Middle East.

Its customers include Israel, which has ordered three more Dolphin class submarines from Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG, and Algeria, which in June was cleared for frigates, armored vehicles and border security systems that newsmagazine Der Spiegel says are worth $14 billion.

German opposition parties and critics within Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right coalition, as well as peace and church groups, are up in arms over the secretive Saudi deal because it underlines a fundamental shift in Germany’s long-restrictive export regulations.

“In her eagerness to support the German defense industry, Merkel is breaking with a traditional doctrine of German foreign policy,” Der Spiegel reports.

“The fundamental principle used to be that weapons produced in Germany couldn’t be delivered to countries engaged in a conflict.

“Now, the government is justifying its deals with strategic arguments, saying the government in Riyadh is needed as a stabilizing force in the Middle East,” Der Spiegel noted.

The previous German government sanctioned arms sales to Saudi Arabia as well but these totaled around $400 million, chickenfeed compared to Berlin’s current military exports to the Middle East.

“This latest tank deal overshadows everything that went before,” Der Spiegel observed. “And no other administration has so blatantly taken on the role of sales representative for the German defense industry.”

The Germans are battling hard for military contracts in the Middle East, where conflict has been a constant since World War II and the post-colonial period. These have long been dominated by the United States, Britain, France and Russia.

…

[T[he government maintains that while the kingdom is a problematic partner, Saudi Arabia plays a key role in mediating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is a crucial ally in the battle against Islamic terrorism.

But most importantly, it says, Saudi Arabia is in the front line against Iran…

This, supporters of arms sale argue, is why the Jewish state didn’t oppose the sale of the 270 Leopard 2A7+ tanks built by Munich’s Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rheinmetall to Saudi Arabia.

The German government’s annual Defense Exports Report, released in early November, said German arms exports grew by 50 percent in 2010.

The report said Germany exported arms and military equipment worth $2.66 billion, including big-ticket items such as submarines, warships and tanks. In 2009, the total was $1.79 billion.

In addition, the report noted, German armaments manufacturers like KMW, almost half of whose sales involve Leopard tanks; naval shipbuilders ThyssenKrupp; firearms-maker Heckler and Koch; and Cassidian, an offshoot of the giant EADS European aerospace consortium, sealed contracts in 2010 with a total value of $6.66 billion.

The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Co., which includes Germany’s DaimlerChryslerAerospace AG, manufactures the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Saudis bought 72 in 2006 for $6 billion.

“Growth doesn’t come from Europe anymore,” explained Cassidian Chief Executive Officer Stefan Zoller.

Defense budgets in Europe are stagnating, he says, and now the biggest opportunities are to be had in the Middle East, along with India and Brazil, both with expanding economies and military forces.

Cassidian recently secured a $2.6 billion contract to build a security system along Saudi Arabia’s 5,600 miles of land border as well as air and seaports, comprising radars, sensors, cameras and other electronic systems.

Vietnam-Style Exit: Russia Could Deliver Death Blow To NATO

Russia could deliver death blow to Nato, say analysts

ISLAMABAD: With the Russian threat to cut land routes for supplies to NATO troops in Afghanistan, the Afghan battleground may turn into a cold death trap for NATO, defence analysts believe. They say that Pakistan should utilise the opportunity for a peaceful and prosperous Pakistan by pulling it out of the American war. 

Russia has threatened to cut off NATO supply routes to Afghanistan if the alliance doesn’t compromise on its missile defence plans. “If NATO doesn’t give a serious response, we have to address matters in relations in other areas,” Russian news services reported. Russia’s cooperation on Afghanistan may be an area for review, the news services reported. 

Pakistan has already cut NATO supply routes after the Mohmand Agency attack by NATO troops that killed twenty-six Pakistani soldiers. Lt General (retd) Hameed Gul, while talking to The News, said that Russia would utilise every option to take revenge on the Americans and the time has come for the Russians to do this. He said that Russia wants to join hands with Pakistan and Pakistan should re-consider its policy towards Russia. “Americans and NATO troops have been strangled in Afghanistan and the time has come for Pakistan to avail itself of the opportunity that it missed on 9/11 to regain respect and sovereignty”, Gul said. 

He mentioned that Americans will have to leave Afghanistan and will ask for concessions and Pakistan should negotiate with them on their exit. If Russia cuts its supply routes then the route will be from Georgia to Baku and then to Azerbaijan, which means NATO will never get the supplies, said Gul. 

“Now NATO troops will have to exit Vietnam-style, and that too by using Pakistan’s airspace because Iran will never let the USA use its airspace”, the retired General said. He mentioned that the war against terror that was started with our own people will come to an end at once and there will be peace in no time once the Americans leave Afghanistan. He said that Indian interests in Afghanistan were growing but India will get nothing from Afghanistan. 

Maria Sultan, defence analyst, while talking to this correspondent said that if the Russians also cut the supply line of NATO then it will turn out to be a cold death for NATO troops. “They will literally be strangled in Afghanistan with 90,000 troops, and as they admit that they have reserves for three months, which actually means they have reserves for two months, then NATO will have to airlift the troops and during the airlift only 15 to 20 percent can get out alive out of the 90,000 troops”, Maria said. 

She mentioned that in Afghanistan everything comes from outside and the insurgency this year has been very high as 700 [NATO] causalities have been reported. Therefore, after the Russian decision, Afghanistan will turn into a reverse Kargil for NATO. “They will have weapons but no bullets to fire; and if Pakistan shuts the air corridors to NATO then it would be a cold death for them and America will have to renegotiate with Pakistan”, she said.

224 Iranian MPs deplore Nato attack on Pakistan

TEHRAN: Iranian parliamentarians in a statement issued on Wednesday condemned the lethal cross-border NATO attack on Pakistan, and called on Islamabad to show a decisive reaction to the US crimes, reported Fars News Agency.

In a joint statement signed by 224 lawmakers, they condemned criminal U.S. acts including its recent airstrike on Pakistan which claimed the lives of the Muslim state’s soldiers. “We ask our counterparts in the Pakistani parliament to review their ties with the U.S.,” the statement read.

“It is the time to give a positive response to the demands of Pakistan’s vigilant nation and prevent the United States’ future crimes and violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity through a decisive move by the Pakistani MPs,” the statement added.

New clash between NATO, Pak forces

KABUL: A cross-border incident involving NATO and Pakistani forces was quickly defused early on Wednesday with no loss of life, The New York Times quoted Brig Gen Carsten Jacobson, the spokesman for the American-led international coalition, as saying. 

The incident apparently involved heavy artillery fire across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, the report said, adding that few other details were available. 

Pakistan’s military, however, refuted the report, saying no such incident took place. “There was no fresh clash between Pakistani troops and NATO force on Pak-Afghan border on Wednesday,” an Inter Services Public Relations spokesman said…

Tribal elders, civil society laud govt’s tough stand on NATO aggression

PESHAWAR: Tribal elders, political workers, lawyers, students and journalists from the Musa Khel tribe of Mohmand Agency condemned the NATO attack on Pakistan’s border security posts and appreciated the bold stance taken by the government of Pakistan in response to these unwarranted and unprovoked attacks. 

They vowed to stand by the Pak-Force in the wake of any eventuality across the border and to protect the motherland from any foreign aggression and intrusion, a communiqué from the Governor’s House read.

This announcement was made during a tribal Jirga comprising peoples from different walks of life, which was led by Senator Muhammad Idrees Khan Safi, and called on Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Masood Kausar here at Governor’s House on Wednesday to record their resentment and offer support to the government against cross-border attacks. 

…The Jirga was of the view that the tribesmen would never tolerate such attacks and were united to safeguard the frontiers of the country at any cost. Governor Kausar, while appreciating the sentiments of the Jirga members, assured them that the government would never compromise on the security and sovereignty of the country. He said that such attacks would neither be ignored nor tolerated.

West’s Military Obsession Leads To Economic Decline

West’s military obsession claws back economic growth
By John Ross 

The US is mired in an unemployment crisis, Europe faces double-dip recession, and Japan’s economy has experienced two decades of stagnation. Under such circumstances a logical policy by governments in developed countries would concentrate all efforts on improving their domestic situation. However in reality, economic resources have been diverted into costly military issues. 

In the US, military expenditure has risen 10 times as fast as household consumption, while government non-military expenditure has fallen. This continues a longer trend. Since the beginning of the 21st century, US GDP, in inflation-adjusted terms, has increased by 21 percent, US government non-military spending by 11 percent, and US personal consumption by 28 percent, while military expenditure increased by 52 percent. 

Such a military buildup appears illogical. The US is the world’s strongest military power. It states its economy is the world’s most competitive, although it clearly faces current difficulties. Increased productive expenditure on R&D, innovation and infrastructure would therefore seem called for rather than higher military expenditure financed by large and destabilizing US budget deficits. 

But instead of US government investment rising, it has fallen as a percentage of GDP since the beginning of the financial crisis in parallel with rising military spending. Similarly the UK government spent $450 million on military action in Libya at the same time as it made massive cuts at home. 

Such economic steps are in line with “neo-con” thinking. This school of thought, despite its protestations to the contrary, actually lacks confidence in US ability to compete in peaceful economic development. It notes that on World Bank data the US economy has fallen from 39 percent of global GDP in 1960 to 23 percent in 2010 and a parallel decline of large US companies – in the last seven years the share of revenue of US corporations in the Forbes Global 2000, the world’s largest companies, has fallen from 39 percent to 31 percent.

Rather than concluding resources should be diverted into boosting the US economy, the neo-cons argue that as the US is losing its once-dominant position in economic competition, questions should be transferred from the economy to the military field where the US is strongest. China is the main enemy in such thinking, as it is the country which has been most successful economically. 

But these ideologues now consider they face internal as well as external enemies. Opinion polls show a majority of the US population believe the Iraq war was a mistake and want a withdrawal from Afghanistan. The logic of the Occupy Wall Street movement, by calling for increased spending on US job creation, supports reductions in military expenditure. For that reason Occupy Wall Street has come in for abuse by the same figures and institutions, such as Fox News and the Tea Party, that are most hostile to China. 

A parallel logic operates in Europe. Sections of the media attempt to blame the continent’s debt crisis on “lazy Europeans.” But in fact the crisis is worst in southern Europe which has longer working weeks and lower social protection than in north European countries such as Germany. 

A lot of confusion exists in the US and Europe about China. Their populations know China is growing economically and is becoming an increasingly important factor in the world. But as this is a recent development they do not yet know what China wants. Overcoming this, making clear the “win-win” outcomes that are possible, will take time.

Despite such confusion, and while these economic and political developments in the US and Europe center on domestic issues, they will affect China. “Neo-con” policies would face China with a military buildup. But if movements seeking to redirect resources from military spending to job creation and social welfare are successful, this will benefit everyone.

U.S. Beefs Up Asia-Pacific Military Bases

US beefs up Asia-Pacific army bases
By Ma Liyao 

BEIJING: The US military presence in the Asia-Pacific region is currently experiencing major changes…

During his visit to Australia this month, US President Barack Obama announced a new security agreement to position more US military personnel and equipment there.

According to the agreement, about 250 US Marines will be stationed in the northern Australian port of Darwin, which is known as Australia’s gateway to Southeast Asia due to its close proximity to Indonesia, which is 820 kilometers away.

A full force of 2,500 military personnel will be stationed there over the next few years.

Compared with the US presence in Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK), Darwin is nearer the South China Sea. 

Obama sidestepped questions about whether the move was aimed at containing China, but said the US would keep sending a clear message that China needs to accept the responsibilities that come with being a world power.

He added that the US was stepping up its commitment to the entire Asia-Pacific region. 

However, “nothing says the United States supports Asia like sending a small marine regiment to Darwin in Australia’s northern territory. Australia is hardly threatened by another foreign invasion from the north – by China or any country”, said the Bangkok Post.

An article published on the Washington Post’s website said the US Navy is close to basing warships in Singapore, on the edge of the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

Negotiations on a deal are in their final stages to base some of the US Navy’s new littoral combat ships, designed to operate in shallow coastal waters and travel at a top speed of more than 40 knots, at the Changi Naval Base in Singapore, the article said.

And to the east of China, US forces in the ROK are relocating their headquarters and combat units to new military facilities in Pyeongtaek, a port city 70 km south of the capital Seoul, and around 340 km from the eastern Chinese city of Rongcheng.

The relocation, due to be completed in 2016, will make Pyeongtaek the main hub of the US military in the ROK, as well as the largest US overseas military base, taking up around 14.6 sq km and housing about 44,000 US troops.

At the same time, a plan was released a week ago to relocate around 8,000 US Marines, including fighting forces, from Okinawa, an island in southwestern Japan, to Guam.

…

Whether Washington is aiming to contain China or not, what can be sure is that it is accelerating the adjustment of its military deployment in order to “step up its commitment” in the Asia-Pacific.

“The strategy means the US has to ensure its Asian allies of its security commitments to them, and at the same time, gain more economic interests and maintain its leadership in the area,” Xu said.

“Now with the decline in its economic influence, it has to play up its military advantage either as a policy instrument or a bargaining chip,” he added.

No official statements have ever linked these deployments directly to China, but this was an opinion held by some observers. 

Japan’s Mainichi Daily News said the plan to relocate US forces on Okinawa aimed to spread out US Marines so they are not overly concentrated in one spot to become easy targets.

The Los Angeles Times said the US president was taking every opportunity during his Asian trips to tell countries neighboring China that Washington is their most reliable “counterweight” to Beijing.

Chinese spokesman rebukes US-Australian military alliance

BEIJING: A Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman on Wednesday criticized the United States’ decision to strengthen its military alliance with Australia.

During US President Barack Obama’s visit to Australia earlier this month, the two states agreed to increase joint military initiatives in order to enhance their alliance.

“Any consolidation or expansion of a military alliance that was forged in history is of the Cold-War model,” said Spokesman Geng Yansheng at a monthly press briefing.

Moves that run contrast to the current trend of peace and cooperation are not helpful in building mutual trust and cooperation among regional countries and will damage their common interests, he said.

Any other military theory aimed at provoking confrontation and safeguarding one’s security at the price of another’s is also backward-thinking, he said.

Kazakhstan, U.S. discuss defense cooperation
K. Konyrova

Astana: Kazakh Defense Minister Adilbek Dzhaksybekov and U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Asian and Pacific Security Affairs discussed future cooperation on Wednesday, the Kazakh Defense Minister reported.

“Cooperation with the United States is one of the most important directions of our foreign policy,” Dzhaksybekov said.

According to Dzhaksybekov, Kazakhstan and the U.S. have a highly dynamic and genuine partnership based on mutual interests in various areas, including defense.

Further cooperation between the countries will be developed within the framework of a bilateral military cooperation plan for the upcoming five-year period (2013-2017).

According to Dzhaksybekov, Kazakhstan is interested in joint defense ventures in its territory to resist the threats of today’s world.

“The threats of today’s world require new methods to counter: the active introduction of digital technology in the Armed Forces, the creation of an appropriate level of protection of information and digital infrastructure,” Dzhaksybekov said.

In order to discuss a number of issues, the foremost of which is securing Asia’s sea areas, Japan, the United States and India began preparations on Nov. 28 for the director-level meeting that is to be held in December in Washington. 

It will be the first meeting of its kind among the three countries.

The three countries hope that they can hold the meeting periodically in turn and upgrade the exchange to the ministerial level in the future. Japan and the United States also hope to strengthen their economic cooperation with India.

Japan is set to establish a strategic partnership with India according to the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which became effective in August 2011 and discuss Japanese Premier Yoshihiko Noda’s upcoming visit to India at the end of 2011.

Russia Condemns NATO Power Play In Kosovo

Moscow slams NATO power games in Kosovo

Russia is concerned with the exacerbation of the situation in northern Kosovo, where NATO forces are pursuing their power politics targeted against Serbs, Russian envoy to the UN Vitaly Churkin is convinced.

­Violence could have been prevented, the diplomat said during a Security Council meeting devoted to the Kosovo settlement, if “KFOR focused on providing security of the region’s residents, as stipulated in their mandate, rather than on eliminating Serbian barricades, which are a response to Pristina’s attempts to take under control the administrative border with Serbia.”

The Russian diplomat also said that Moscow has supported the Serbian government’s appeal to the UN secretary-general to thoroughly investigate an incident on September 27, when KFOR resorted to force, leading to a number of civilian casualties. 

Russia also insists on a full and objective probe into cases of human organ trafficking revealed by member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Dick Marty.

The process of the return to Kosovo of displaced people, most of whom are Serbs, is unsatisfactory, Vitaly Churkin went on to say. And one of the main reasons for this is that those people are not confident of their security. In addition, “incidents of looting and theft of Kosovo Serbs’ property remain unpunished.”

He also demanded that all necessary measures be taken for the defense of Orthodox shrines and believers. 

“The UN mission to Kosovo should play a most active role in Kosovo settlement,” the Russian envoy to the UN stressed.

On November 29, at least two Kosovan Serbs and two NATO peacekeepers were injured in a fresh wave of violence near the town of Zubin Potok in the north of Kosovo. Serbs were protesting NATO’s attempts to remove a barricade made of buses and trucks that was blocking a main road in the region. NATO responded by firing rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons at the demonstrators. Churkin called the incident “outrageous.”

Russia May Cancel Chicago NATO Meeting Over Interceptor Missiles

Russia may drop NATO summit over missile defense

Russia is uncertain as to whether or not it will take part in the NATO-Russia summit in Chicago in May next year due to a deadlock in missile defense talks.

Moscow’s consent for the gathering “should not be taken as predetermined,” said Deputy Director of the Department for Security and Disarmament of the Russian Foreign Ministry Vladimir Leontyev, cites Itar-Tass. The diplomat stressed though that Russia is not closing the door on co-operation. 

“Our partners should view current problems fairly and responsibly,” Leontyev said. “Otherwise, Russia will have to give adequate responses as the US missile defense system is being created in Europe.”

Earlier on Wednesday, Yury Gorlach, deputy director of the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Department on European Cooperation, said that Moscow is waiting for “a clear political signal” from the military bloc indicating that it is ready to continue the dialogue on the matter…

The Russia-NATO negotiations on the US planned missile defense system have been going on for months, but yielded few results so far, as the sides are standing firm in their positions. Russia said it would accept the invitation to participate in the project, but only as an equal partner and if Washington provides legally-binding guarantees that the proposed missiles would not threaten its national security. The US declined to do so. 

On Tuesday, President Dmitry Medvedev ordered operational the newest Russian radar system that protects from missile attacks and covers all Europe and Atlantic. Medvedev said that it was a sign to Western partners that Russia was ready to adequately respond to possible threats to its strategic nukes that might appear with the launch of the European missile defense.

Russia Could Cancel Summit With NATO Due to Antimissile Impasse

Russia could cancel a planned summit next spring in Chicago with NATO over continued differences with the Western military bloc’s plans for European missile defenses, Russia Today reported on Wednesday (see GSN, Nov. 29).

The Kremlin’s intention to attend the summit “should not be taken as predetermined,” Russian Foreign Ministry security and disarmament Deputy Director Vladimir Leontyev said. He emphasized, however, that the government was not taking off the table possible cooperation with NATO on missile defense, ITAR-Tass reported.

Russia objects to a U.S. plan to over the course of the decade deploy increasingly advanced sea- and land-based missile interceptors around Europe as a declared shield against a feared ballistic missile strike from the Middle East. Moscow suspects the interceptors would secretly also be aimed at undermining its long-range nuclear weapons – a charge that Washington adamantly denies. NATO and Russia have failed in a year of talks to reach agreement on a cooperative missile shield for Europe.

“Our partners should view current problems fairly and responsibly. Otherwise, Russia will have to give adequate responses as the U.S. missile defense system is being created in Europe,” Leontyev said.

Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned recently that should differences on the missile shield persist his nation could withdraw from the New START nuclear arms control accord with the United States and deploy short-range Iskander missiles in the Kaliningrad region, which borders several NATO states.

…

Talks between NATO and Russia have run aground over differing views about what potential antimissile collaboration would involve. Moscow favors a unified approach while NATO would like to see two separate but connected missile shields.

Moscow is also frustrated by its inability thus far to obtain a binding guarantee that U.S. missile interceptors in Europe would not be aimed at Russia’s strategic forces.

Russian Ambassador to NATO Dmitry Rogozin in January is scheduled to travel to China and Iran for discussions about U.S. plans to deploy missile shield elements in Poland, Romania and Turkey, the FARS News Agency reported.

“We are planning to visit both Tehran and Beijing soon under the Russian president’s directive, to discuss the planned deployment of a global missile defense network,” Rogozin said to Russian lawmakers (Fars News Agency, Nov. 29).

Russia and Cuba to strengthen military cooperation 

Moscow: Moscow is considering strengthening its military relations with Cuba ahead of parliamentary elections in Russia. 

Against the backdrop of a renewed Cold War climate, Russia and Cuba are planning to sign a deal for the construction of a plant where ammunition for both AK-47 assault rifles and other Russian-made assault rifles will be produced. The plant will be located within the Ernesto Che Guevara military base in Cuba.

Russian arms in US backyard: Back in Cuba

Russia has launched a military partnership project with its Cold War ally Cuba, amid rising tensions over US plans to deploy an anti-missile system in Europe.

Russian contractors are to supply production equipment for manufacturing 6.52-mm rifle rounds, Kommersant daily reports. Cuban arms plant called Comandante Ernesto Che Guevara will also receive a license and technology for recycling used ammo.

The daily cites its sources as saying that Havana officials decided to purchase the equipment after visiting a similar production line in Venezuela. The insider did not reveal any details on the financial terms of the future deal, but said it was close to being sealed.

Russian arms producers further hope to win a contract for upgrading the whole ammunition plant in the future. It was built in late 1970s early 1980s with the help of Soviet specialists.

The United States are maintaining a decades-old trade blockade of Cuba. Russian companies, which would supply military equipment there, risk sanctions by the US.

Communist Cuba was a major ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War era, with an estimated gross value of arms supplied to Havana reaching $16 billion. The USSR delivered tanks, Mig fighter jets, helicopters, rocket air defense systems, submarines, small arms, communication equipment among other things. The close military collaboration resulted in the most serious tension of the period, when Moscow deployed its missiles on the island in response to a similar move by the US in Turkey.

The collapse of the USSR and the economic perils new Russia faced weakened its trade and military ties with Cuba. In 2001 Russia shut down the radio reconnaissance base in Cuba, the last of its military facilities there.

However in the late 2000s Moscow and Havana began to re-establish relations on many levels. In September 2008 two Russian strategic bombers carrying top Air Forces brass visited Venezuela. The aviation generals also visited Cuba and later voiced possible plans for renting and upgrading an air base on the La Orchila Island, which would allow Russian military aircraft patrol the Caribbean.

Also in 2008, Russian Army generals visited Cuba to inspect its air defense forces. Possible upgrade of the old equipment and supply of spare parts was on the table. The moves were viewed by many observers as Russian response to the Bush administration plans to deploy an anti-ballistic missile system in Europe.

The news on the upcoming round production deal comes as Moscow and Washington are reaching new heights of tension over AMD system. The US refuses to provide guaranties that the system would not be used against Russia.

Russia’s latest move in the row was to open a new early warning radar in its western exclave, the Kaliningrad Region. President Medvedev has also threatened deployment of short-range ballistic missiles capable of destroying American ABM facilities, should it be required.

Vladimir Anokhin, the vice president of the Academy of Geopolitical Problems, does not believe that signing the military contract with Cuba is some kind of Russian geopolitical answer to US plans to deploy an anti-ballistic missile system in Europe.

“This is a common business deal by Rosoboronexport,” Anokhin said.

Anokhin however noted that Cuba has always been in Russia’s “area of interest” and said that at this moment no one can hamper the improvement of Russia-Cuba military cooperation.

“As a sovereign state we will not fall under any sanctions from the US,” Anokhin said. “At this point the US is not in a position [to ban Russia trade with Cuba]. It will be more trouble for the US than it is worth.”

Germany approves sale of sixth nuclear-capable submarine to Israel

Germany has approved the sale of a sixth Dolphin submarine to Israel and will pay for a third of its cost, government sources told dpa on Wednesday.

Israel already has three German-made Dolphin submarines, which are capable of carrying missiles with nuclear warheads. Berlin paid for two of the submarines and the cost of the third was shared between the two countries. Two more are being constructed.

The government sources said Germany had allocated up to 135 million euros (180 million dollars) in next year’s budget to pay for its share of the cost for the sixth submarine, the sale of which is part of a deal finalized in 2005.

The submarines are seen as a strategic asset for Israel in any future confrontation with Iran…Israel is believed to have the Middle East’s only nuclear arsenal, a claim it neither confirms nor denies.

Dagan said Syria also can join this war, and it means that Israel will be isolated.

NATO and Partner Countries discuss New Challenges to Global Security 

About 200 experts from NATO and partner countries gathered in Brussels on 28 November 2011 for the first conference on “New Challenges to Global Security” organised by NATO’s new Emerging Security Challenges Division. 

“Many of these challenges cannot be kept at bay by the mere threat of military retaliation; and many require a much stronger focus on prevention and on enhancing the resilience of our infrastructure”, said the head Emerging Security Challenges Division, Assistant Secretary General Gabor Iklódy, welcoming participants from NATO and partner countries and from academic institutions. 

The conference was an opportunity for security matter experts to look closely at the new Division’s agenda, ranging from threats to cyber networks and international terrorism to securing energy supplies and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. During the discussions, participants encouraged NATO’s Emerging Security Challenges Division to expand partnerships and enhance capabilities in dealing with modern threats. Assistant Secretary General Iklódy noted the importance of working together with partners…

The conference was sponsored by the Alliance’s “Science for Peace and Security” Programme and Carnegie Europe.

<em>BHL should be immediately arrested and tried for being an active accomplice of crimes against humanity.</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/mkerone/" target="_blank">MKERone</a></strong>

In an article published in French magazine Paris Match (17th to 23rd November 2011 issue), which magazine is controlled by French largest press company <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.lagardere.com/activites/lagardere-active-2610.html" target="_blank">The Lagardère Group</a> (M. Lagardère is a very close friend of Nicolas Sarkozy) we can read/learn some incredible facts about the infamous Bernard Henri Levy involvement in the illegal and unjustified war on Libya ( Read more about him <a href="http://counterpsyops.com/2011/10/11/the-reason-why-a-franco-german-tv-channel-will-broadcast-a-biased-anti-syrian-documentary-tonight/">here</a>, <a href="http://counterpsyops.com/2011/09/27/wadah-khanfar-al-jazeera-and-the-triumph-of-televised-propaganda/">here</a>, <a href="http://counterpsyops.com/2011/11/03/burying-the-darfur-genocide-myth-bernard-henri-levy/">here</a> and <a href="http://counterpsyops.com/2011/11/09/bernard-henri-levy-you-evil-bastard-warmonger-libya-war-afghanistan/">here</a>).

First off, the magazine explains that Bernard Henri Levy (BHL) has been promoting the "responsibility to protect" - <em>in other words: the right for western countries to indiscriminately bomb sovereign nations considered as "non aligned" or too independent -</em> for over 30 years. And it claims that the "fall of Muammar Gaddafi" is the brilliant achievement of this "fight". This simple sentence shows how desperately the French Press is trying to make direct intervention of world's most powerful and criminal army, NATO, appear as something morally right and necessary to keep world peace and to save innocent civilians.

Further in the article, and as above picture shows, the magazine goes on saying that BHL provided NATO with bombing coordinates to kill Libyan Green Resistance fighters. We can also learn that BHL transported weapons. Needless to ask who he gave those weapon to, or on behalf of whom he did so...

This is beyond imagination. This man is clearly admitting that he ACTIVELY participated in an illegal regime change that the Libyans didn't want, the slaughter of innocent civilians and the destruction of the wealthiest African country, and no legal action whatsoever is taken against him. He keeps being invited in TV shows, gets mainstream media support for promoting his books, all TV channels call on him to have his views on geopolitics... I almost can't believe that this is happening. How come French people don't realize what's unfolding right before their eyes. Are they that bling, ignorant, or are they just careless? None of these answers would satisfy me anyway. People really need to wake up!!!

Anyone stealing food to survive and to feed his/her kids can go to jail, but this man participating in massive killings is free like a bird...  He should be immediately arrested and tried for being an active accomplice of crimes against humanity and Genocide! What kind of world are we living in?

Do not hesitate to contact with BHL to let him know what you think about him and his "accomplishments":

I tried all sorts of ways to find the article mentioned with no luck whatsoever.
Whaddya wanna bet they deleted it? ;)
I can't even get Parismatch.com although there are all sorts of signs of it.
Hmmmmmmm.  I think we either delete the mention of the relevant edition or
we wait for the author to make an appearance.  I'll see if I can get hold of him. ;)

Quoriana, I replied to you via twitter.
This article is only on paper. Paris Match doesn't publsih the same content online and on paper. Or just snapshosts on the web to promote the paper version.

I took pictures of the magazine so if you want to see them I can send them by email. I can't post them though, for copyright matters.

The article I'm talking about was found on the 23rd to 27th November issue. And its title is:  Bernard Henri Levy: Ma Guerre en Libye

Trust all is clear.
If you need further info do not hesitate to contact me

Sincerely

<strong>By Gerald A. Perreira</strong>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>This is the dark time, my love,</em>
<em> All round the land brown beetles crawl about</em>
<em> The shining sun is hidden in the sky</em>
<em> Red flowers bend their heads in awful sorrow</em>
<em> This is the dark time, my love,</em>
<em> It is the season of oppression, dark metal, and tears.</em>
<em> It is the festival of guns, the carnival of misery</em>
<em> Everywhere, the faces of men are strained and anxious</em>
<em> Who comes walking in the dark night time?</em>
<em> Whose boot of steel tramps down the slender grass</em>
<em> It is the man of death, my love, the stranger invader</em>
<em> Watching you sleep and aiming at your dream.</em>
<em> Martin Carter</em></p>
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17248" title="240x_mg_muammar_qaddafi" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/240x_mg_muammar_qaddafi.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />All of the good that Muammar Qaddafi did for his people, and the immeasurable contribution he made to the oppressed peoples of the world is catalogued everywhere for those who have eyes to see. NATO's war crimes are also catalogued – they went viral, so even in the absence of a court where NATO and their mercenaries can be tried, millions of people worldwide watched, at their computers and TV screens, the horrific war crimes that unfolded in Sirte and elsewhere in Libya. The verdicts are in. The question is what can be done about it. The world was quite literally watching and still can watch, anytime they care to google the litany of obscene crimes committed, when a coalition of the most powerful nations on this earth, backed up by the vast majority of Arab and African misleaders, deployed the most sophisticated arsenal of weaponry in the history of the world against a small bastion of African resistance. In the now famous cities of Sirte and Bani Walid, Colonel Muammar Abu Minyar al-Qaddafi led his people in a courageous battle which lasted for months. The battles of Sirte and Bani Walid have surely earned their place in the annals of African history.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-17243" title="Jaber" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Jaber.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="263" />At his side were his son, Mutassim Qaddafi and Libya's Minister of Defense, and one of the leaders of the 1969 Al Fateh revolution, Major General Abu-Bakr Yunis Jaber. Decades ago, he and the young Muammar were in the same class at the Military Academy in Benghazi and were co- founders of the Free Officers' Movement which overthrew King Idris.

Both men, spiritual heirs of Omar Al Mukhtar's armed resistance against the Italian invaders in 1911, were in their 70s. Having to witness such a savage attack on them and not being able to do anything to defend them against NATO's jackals, was traumatizing.

The core group of revolutionaries, who led the Al Fateh revolution in 1969 in their twenties, all now in their late 60s and 70s, chose to stay at their posts and fight alongside the people, despite having received many offers for safe passage out of Libya.

[caption id="attachment_17244" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="Sirte following NATO&#39;s bombardment."]<img class="size-large wp-image-17244" title="Sirte-destroyed" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Sirte-destroyed-500x321.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="321" />[/caption]

<strong>A Picture Tells a 1000 Words</strong>
This picture of Sirte, after NATO's bombardment, is worth more than a thousand words when it comes to understanding what actually took place in this once beautiful and prosperous African city. And all in the name of 'protecting civilians' – clearly with the exception of civilians loyal to Muammar Qaddafi and the Al Fateh revolution. We salute all of those who fought to defend Al Fateh and the Pan African project in Sirte, Bani Walid and throughout Libya. They are the real Jihadists – the true Pan-African Army.

Julius Malema, ANC Youth Leader, in reference to the North Atlantic Tribes, asked the question – why are these people so bloodthirsty? He pointed out that they did not seem to understand anything other than war.

It is no surprise that Julius Malema has been banned by Jacob Zuma's ANC. Zuma is one of those African misleaders who signed Qaddafi's death warrant, when South Africa, along with Nigeria and French controlled Gabon, all temporary members of the so-called Security Council at the time, agreed to the implementation of a 'No Fly Zone', which unleashed the demons of war.

Let us not imagine that they did not know what would ensue – the entire world has just witnessed the destruction of Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a painful blow to many Africans in Africa and throughout the world. We remembered Nelson Mandela's now famous speech, when on the world stage he called Muammar Qaddafi 'one of the great freedom fighters of the 20th century' and he publicly thanked the Brother Leader and the people of Libya for the material and moral support provided to the ANC when, as Mandela put it – their 'backs were up against the wall'. The half hearted attempts by the AU to take the necessary action to defend Libya was shameful and demoralizing.

<strong>There was a time…</strong>
Some of it in my lifetime, when we had visionary, principled and courageous African leaders - Shaka Zulu, Queen Nzingha, Cetshwayo, Dedan Kimathi, Julius Nyerere, Ahmed Sekou Toure, Kwame Nkrumah, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Marien Ngouabi, Ahmed Ben Bella, Samora Machel, Thomas Sankara, Murtala Muhammad, Laurent Kabila to name but a few. Had leaders such as these been in power today, NATO could not have gotten away with invading Libya. The fact is, with few exceptions, the current bunch of African leaders, many of them put in place by the forces of white supremacy, were just not up to the job.

Those who are misleading Africa today – 'who the cap fit let them wear it' – have paid a dear price. What is coming our way will be punishment for such a colossal betrayal. And sadly, we will all suffer for their sins.

The murder of Muammar Qaddafi plunged us into despair. We mourned his death as sons mourn their father - he called us his sons and we responded as such because we understood his sincerity.

Those who worked with Qaddafi can testify that the Brother Leader's efforts were motivated by a strong and uncompromising faith in God, his deep love for humanity and a sincere desire to assist all those engaged in the struggle to end injustice and oppression. If anyone epitomized Che Guevara's famous quote, it was our brother: 'Revolutionaries are first human beings, and at the risk of sounding utterly ridiculous, revolution is based upon supreme feelings of love'.

Those among the leadership of Al Fateh who were not murdered were captured. Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim, one of the foremost exponents of the Third Universal Theory, an intellectual warrior and committed Pan-Africanist, was captured while defending Sirte. The uncle of Moussa Ibrahim, who over the past months became known as the spokesperson for the legitimate government of Libya, he is currently being held in Misurata, and his son, Yurub Ibrahim, has also been arrested. The well known Islamic scholar Sheik Khaled Tantoush, has been abducted from his home in Sirte and is also being held in Misurata. These elderly men are being subjected to constant taunting, beatings and torture and their condition is deteriorating rapidly. Global campaigns have been launched to demand the protection under international law and conventions, regarding prisoners of war, for high-profile prisoners Saif-al-Islam Qaddafi, Abdullah Senussi, Ahmed Ibrahim, Khaled Tantoush and the thousands of prisoners held by the NTC. (see websites Libya SOS, Libya 360 and Mathaba.net for ways you can assist the campaign and video footage of how these elderly prisoners are being treated).

[caption id="attachment_17245" align="alignleft" width="220" caption="Dr Ahmed Ibrahim tormented by his captors."]<img class="size-full wp-image-17245" title="Ahmed-Ibrahim" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Ahmed-Ibrahim.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="155" />[/caption]

In addition to loyalty to the Leader, and defense of their country against foreign invaders, having black skin and asserting one's Africanity has become a crime in the new Libya. Ethnic cleansing is continuing unabated. Every day Black Africans from Libya and other parts of Africa are hunted down. Thousands have been brutally tortured and executed. Rape of Black women is a favored weapon of NATO's Islamists. Many of the female bodies found show signs of rape, beatings and torture. Large numbers of Black Africans make up the ranks of the Green Resistance.

<strong>NATO's Living Hell</strong>

One Tripoli resident, who cannot be named, told me:

'Everyone is terrified of the NTC and their armed gangs. We have seen with our own eyes what they are capable of – they are animals. All around us people are being rounded up and imprisoned. We have no way of knowing how many have been murdered. Anyone who is associated with Qaddafi or suspected of loyalty to him is at risk. Even people who have worked for people who are known supporters of the leader have been rounded up and tortured. I personally know of many persons who were just working for people associated with the leader who have been taken away and never seen again. If you are black you are an immediate suspect – these rebels call black Libyans 'abd' means slave and they are rounding them up just because they are black – it is making me sick and ashamed.

What these rebels have done to their own people is disgusting – some of the acts of torture I can't even speak about. There has been a lot of rape. I wept when I learned of what these animals did to the leader's female body guards – they are not human and that is why there is so much fear. Any known Qaddafi loyalists who have not been able to get out of Libya have to stay underground. Libyans are afraid to talk to other Libyans – anyone could be an informer. It feels like the last days are upon us – Libya has been turned into a living hell.'

There is now a complete whiteout by the corporate media regarding all news from Libya. And of course, although a genocide is unfolding right before our eyes, there will be no outcry from the UN, Amnesty International or that euphemistic chorus known as 'the international community', that bleats on ad nauseum about 'democracy, human rights and the rule of law'. No time or motive for outcry – having shared the spoils, they have already moved on to their next victims – Syria and Iran.

<strong>Demons Unleashed</strong>
To do their dirty work, NATO employed the most barbaric marauders they could find. These Islamist mercenaries are programmed, sadistic fighters – they have been on the battlefields in Iraq, Afghanistan and now Libya. They have been hired many times over by NATO, who characteristically plays all sides, and that is why they need to sprinkle stimulant powders on their food - to keep them in killing mode.

Shouting Allahu Akhbar, like robots, they go from town to town, city to city, ransacking, beating, torturing, raping and murdering, and then, in their crazed state, with inflated feelings of omnipotence, they actually take footage of themselves committing heinous war crimes and post them on YouTube.

As the people bury their dead, they defiantly whisper, 'Allah, Muammar, Libya and nothing else'. Amidst the screams that can be heard deep into the night, a shell-shocked population tries to understand what happened to them, and struggles to come to terms with the obscene end inflicted on a man they loved. Now they must try to find a way to confront the 'brave new world' that has been imposed upon them by this foreign invasion. In an instant, they have been transported back in time to when Europeans last occupied their country.

<strong>Green Resistance – It is only a matter of time…</strong>
The war in Libya is far from over. The corporate media continues the lie that Libya has been 'liberated' and that life there has 'returned to normal'. In truth, chaos reigns. Rumours about NATO's plans to carve up the country are rife and Libya remains engulfed in warfare.

People are being systematically hunted down. Truck loads of bodies are being carted away, as the now feuding armed gangs, each with their own command structure, and none adhering to anything the NTC says, introduces the only policy they ever had – exterminate Qaddafi and all those loyal to him. That numbers in the millions and they are stopping at nothing to track them down.

The Green resistance referred to as the Libyan Liberation Army (LLA) or the Libyan Liberation Front (LLF) is regrouping and growing stronger by the day. Street battles are commonplace, explosions can be heard all over Tripoli and in other regions, and NATO's mercenaries are facing fierce resistance.

Libya's powerful Warfalla Tribe, comprising more than a million Libyans, have stated that 'they are thirsting for revenge', many of them having fought in the battle of Bani Walid.

'It does not matter how long it takes, we will rise again as sure as the sun rises. It is only a matter of time. It may not be today – we are a patient people. Right now, many of us have to lay low while the leaders regroup and put certain things in place so that we can take our resistance to the next level, but we know our time will come and we are only waiting for the word to take up our arms.

We have to be organized and this takes time, especially under the present conditions of occupation. Our people are being tortured and raped and murdered for supporting the leader and defending their revolution. We have had to leave our homes and watch these dogs destroy them and steal everything from us. But our day will come – we can never forget the crimes committed against us by NATO and these murdering thieves who call themselves revolutionaries and Muslims.

What I have seen with my own two eyes is unbelievable – people committing the cruelest acts - crimes against humanity while they cry out Allahu Akhbar. They are like drugged people. We have uncovered mass graves of Qaddafi loyalists – with their hands tied behind their backs - all executed. I want to tell them that every person they tortured, every person murdered, every woman they raped, every home they destroyed and looted and everything they did to our dear leader and his family will be avenged.

This is not the first time this has happened to us Libyans – this is exactly what happened to us when the Italians occupied our land – thanks to the leader we are a very educated people now – we know our history and our heroes. The NTC has already taken the picture of Omar Al Mukhtar off the Libyan dinar but it does not matter – they can destroy every picture of Omar Al Mukhtar and the leader, because the story of his bravery and the bravery of his son Muammar Qaddafi is in our hearts – these men can never die - and this gives us the belief and certainty that we will overcome these thieves again – believe me, it is only a matter of time.'

<strong>A Frenzied Phase</strong>
The invasion of Libya and the murder of Muammar Qaddafi ushered in what can be described as the empire's 'frenzied phase'. Capitalism and imperialism are taking their last hideous gasps, and in this phase we will see their evil laid bare. NATO will continue to become ever more brazen with its 'shock and horror' tactics, believing that they are unstoppable and invincible, as once did Rome. In other words, with the imperialists in panic mode, we can expect their behavior to become all the more barbaric, savage and uncivilized, as has been prophesied.

<strong>The Twilight Zone – Vampires of Empire</strong>
The additional dimension in this new phase is that capitalism, White supremacy's socio-economic system, has entered a period of unprecedented crisis – it is on its last legs and the system is turning in on itself. The vampires of empire do indeed 'suck the blood of the sufferer'. They are desperate now and quite literally don't care if they are seen to be dripping in our blood. Their global economic arrangement is crumbling faster than they can hold their next summit, and we cannot be caught off guard.

We have watched Europe and the US forestall their collapse for a number of years, to the point where they are frantic and fast running out of ideas. As fast as they share the spoils of one war – they need another to quench their insatiable appetite for plunder. Our trouble is, that many of us are too slow to follow the visionary leadership in their midst. Had African leaders shared the vision, united and worked together toward a United States of Africa as Qaddafi pleaded, the world would have been a very different place today. Muammar Qaddafi and the Libyan revolution were on the verge of bringing about a total shift in the global balance of power, and giving Africa its rightful place in the world. We have never been so close to reasserting African power. He was truly a Lion of Africa.

<strong>A Ruthless Enemy – Know Them</strong>
The North Atlantic Tribes are an extremely ruthless enemy. It is necessary to study and understand their mentality in order to build an effective resistance. Indisputably, there is good and bad in every race. However, also indisputably, the historical and cultural continuum known as Europe has specificities that no other group on the face of this earth has demonstrated. Their will to dominate, consume and destroy is unparalleled.

Marimba Ani, in her seminal work, Yurugu, An Afrikan-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and Behavior, offers an incisive analysis of the European mindset. In her words:

'All modes of European behavior and dominant styles of action act to increase and ensure material control…The power ideology that defines the total culture keeps it off- balance. The culture itself – always 'progressing', never 'progressed' – is unidirectional, one dimensional, fanatical, and atrophied; a culture that must consume others. But ultimately this ideology is incoherent; it literally lacks human meaning. It is the compulsiveness, the drive, the insatiable appetite of the culture that are its distinguishing features…it is as well-constructed as a power machine can be…For success it has sacrificed 'soul'. What is left is profane. Aesthetically, and in terms of self-image, it identifies as white. Europe is the cultural home of a people who identify as one race; i.e., banding together for survival and destruction of others. They would destroy each other if there were not others to destroy. They fear and hate blackness, which they associate with spiritual power – a power which they can neither possess, create nor control.'

In White Racism: A Psychohistory, Joel Kovel describes this drive to conquer and destroy as a 'cosmic yearning', 'a bottomless longing'.

Samuel Huntington, author of the Clash of Civilizations reminds us of something that we should never forget: 'The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion, but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence.'

That is the reason why the enemy gets so agitated when we organize armed resistance, because they know how powerful organized violence can be.

The invasion of Libya and the murder of Qaddafi is what happened to a nation and its leader when they gave up their program to develop 'weapons of mass destruction' and opted for a path of peaceful coexistence. In an interview at the beginning of the war, Saif Qaddafi admitted that Libya had been caught 'unprepared for war', having not even upgraded their conventional weaponry. No nation will ever make that fatal mistake again. The North Atlantic Tribes can never be trusted. Deterrents of any kind are better than no deterrents at all.

The North Atlantic Tribes have mastered the art of war and perfected weaponry like no other peoples in history. They are the quintessential warlords.

In order to carry out this regrab, in their desperate and frenzied attempt to hasten their plunder of Africa and the global south's wealth, it is imperative for the imperialists to get rid of all revolutionary nationalist regimes that might stand in their way, and ensure that compliant regimes are firmly in place. We must prepare ourselves for what is to come. In his last message, the Brother Leader warned us to 'hold down our corners' because if they get past Libya they are coming for all of us. The challenge in this phase is to find ways to cope with the Empire's collapse and to strengthen our resistance in order to confront the frantic and barbaric behavior which will inevitably characterize their demise.

<strong>Their House is Burning - Not Ours</strong>
At a global economic summit in 2009, former President of Brazil, Lula Da Silva, when commenting on the global economic crisis, stated, 'This was a crisis that was fostered and boosted by the irrational behavior of people who were white and blue-eyed, who before the crisis looked like they knew everything about economics, but now have demonstrated they know nothing about economics' He added, 'The part of humanity that is responsible should be the part that pays for the crisis.'

Too many of us are still, as Malcolm X put it, 'house negroes'. The house negro lived in the master's house and when the master's house was burning, he said 'we house burning'. If the master was sick, the house negro said 'we sick'. And then there was the field negro. When he saw the master's house burning he said 'Let it burn'.

In Africa, South America, the Caribbean and throughout the global south, we have been in crisis for centuries as a result of the imperialists' endless thirst for domination, plunder and war. It is the master's house that is burning this time. And we say – 'let it burn'. The demise of this empire is a welcome thing. We don't need to concern ourselves with bringing Babylon down, for it is surely crumbling – politically, economically, ideologically and morally, due to its own internal contradictions. In the meantime, as Muammar Qaddafi urged, 'we must build the new as the old crumbles around us'. Only then can we be ready. It is not the end of the world – it is the end of their world.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/wikileaks-details-surveillance-industry/story-e6frf7jx-1226211881105

WIKILEAKS founder, Julian Assange, has launched the website's new project - the publication of hundreds of files detailing a global industry that gives governments tools to spy on their citizens.

They reveal the activities of about 160 companies in 25 countries that develop technologies to allow the tracking and monitoring of individuals by their mobile phones, email accounts and internet browsing histories.

"Today we release over 287 files documenting the reality of the international mass surveillance industry - an industry which now sells equipment to dictators and democracies alike in order to intercept entire populations," Mr Assange said today.

He said that in the past 10 years it had grown from a covert industry that primarily supplied government intelligence agencies such as the NSA in the United States and Britain's GCHQ, to a huge transnational business.

Mr Assange has been in Britain for the past year fighting extradition to Sweden for questioning on allegations of rape and sexual assault, living under tight bail conditions.

His case is due to come up again on December 5.

The documents on the website, http://wikileaks.org/the-spyfiles.html, include manuals for surveillance products sold to repressive Arab regimes.

They have come to light, in part, from offices ransacked during rebellions in countries such as Egypt and Libya earlier this year, as well as investigative work by WikiLeaks and its media and campaigning partners.

"These systems that are revealed in these documents show exactly the kind of systems that the Stasi wished they could have built," said Jacob Appelbaum, a former WikiLeaks spokesman and computer expert at the University of Washington.

"These systems have been sold by Western companies to places, for example, like Syria and Libya and Tunisia and Egypt. These systems are used to hunt people down and to murder."

Experts who worked on the release warned that, at present, the industry was completely unregulated, and urged governments worldwide to introduce new laws governing the export of such technology.]]></content:encoded>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17276" title="27980" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/27980.jpg" alt="" width="297" height="279" />
<em>Ron Paul warned the American people that their nation was becoming a "police state" and stated that Obama had violated the War Powers Act over his actions against Libya.</em>

The Federal Security Service (FSB) is reporting on November 30 that the “<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20111128p2g00m0dm006000c.html" target="_blank">secret letter</a>” sent to Prime Minister Putin by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda contains a warning that United States President Barack Obama has issued an executive-level “<em>kill order</em>” against <a href="http://www.ronpaul2012.com/who-is-ron-paul/" target="_blank">US Congressman Ron Paul</a> over fears this charismatic politician, who many believe could capture the Republican Presidential 2012 nomination, is about to expose to all Americans what can only be described as the largest mass theft in human history. The “kill order” is a metaphor for silencing down congressman Ron Paul in the mass media as if he doesn’t exist.

According to this report, Prime Minister Noda first became aware of this “kill order” after a private meeting with Obama at last weeks ASEAN Summit meeting in Indonesia when the American President expressed his “unconstrained joy” over the toppling of the Greek and Italian governments in <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2063756/Eurocrats-imposed-Greece-Italy-Id-governed-100-people-phone-book.html?ito=feeds-newsxml" target="_blank">bloodless coups</a> by EU banksters who installed to run these countries unelected <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-14/goldman-sachs-says-adviser-mario-monti-resigns-his-post-at-firm.html" target="_blank">former Goldman Sachs executives</a>.

Not known to many Americans is that the giant global investment firm <strong><a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a></strong> put Obama into office by being its <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://articles.cnn.com/2010-04-20/politics/obama.goldman.donations_1_obama-campaign-presidential-campaign-federal-election-commission-figures?_s=PM:POLITICS" target="_blank">top donor</a> and after winning the Presidency put so many of its former executives into the US government it is known as the “<a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=13208" target="_blank">Wall Street Cabinet</a>.”

The reason for Goldman Sachs, and other top American and European banksters, putting Obama into office, this report continues, was to loot the Americans taxpayers of an estimated $100 Trillion…nearly $30 Trillion of which went directly into the pockets of international banksters around the world and another $70 Trillion in lost home values, stock portfolios and pensions funds.

The main conduit of this massive theft was the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.federalreserve.gov/" target="_blank">US Federal Reserve System</a> which during <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_financial_crisis" target="_blank">the 2008 Financial Crisis</a></strong> secretly doled out, without the American peoples knowledge, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://survivalacres.com/wordpress/?p=2285" target="_blank">over $16 Trillion</a> to European banks and companies and another <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://bottomline.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/11/28/9067808-fed-lent-banks-nearly-8-trillion-during-crisis-report-shows" target="_blank">nearly $8 Trillion</a> in “<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/economy-a-budget/195707-ron-paul-should-hold-hearings-on-secret-fed-bailouts" target="_blank">secret loans</a>” to the largest banks in the United States.

Causing Obama and his bankster allies to fear Ron Paul, this report continues, is the Congressman’s ability <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/economy-a-budget/195707-ron-paul-should-hold-hearings-on-secret-fed-bailouts" target="_blank">to hold US Congressional hearings</a> on the $8 Trillion in secret loans to the largest banks in American without the public’s knowledge exposing this largest theft in human history and laying bare for all to see the total criminality of their entire elite political, financial and corporate class.

Though the US mainstream media has virtually ignored Ron Paul’s candidacy the American people themselves appear to have broken through this deliberate government ordered blackout of his Presidential run as evidenced by his rise in the polls in the first campaign States of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, which should he win them all would assure him the Republican nomination.

The fears Ron Paul is causing among Americas elite classes appear to be justified as he recently likened the US Federal Reserve System to “<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://news.yahoo.com/ron-paul-federal-drug-addiction-183216336.html" target="_blank">drug addiction</a>” warning that the deception it has foisted upon the public will lead to the destruction of the United States.

Ron Paul further warned the American people this year that their nation was becoming a “police state,” <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://blog.chron.com/txpotomac/2011/10/ron-paul-obama-should-be-impeached-for-al-qaeda-killing/" target="_blank">called for the impeachment of Obama</a> for ordering the assassination of an American citizen without charges or trial, and stated that Obama had <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.rawstory.com/rawreplay/2011/06/ron-paul-obama-violated-war-powers-resolution-and-u-s-constitution/" target="_blank">violated the War Powers Act</a> over his actions against Libya.

Ron Paul’s fears of a police state America being ruled by a dictatorial tyrant were confirmed yesterday when the US Senate, in a <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/nov/29/senate-defies-obama-veto-threat-terrorist-custody-/" target="_blank">61-37 vote</a> gave, for the first time in history, the power to the US Military to hold citizens without charges or trial indefinitely by passing a bill that was <a href="http://ppjg.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/s-1867-hunting-americans/" target="_blank">written in secret and never openly debated</a>.

So frightening is this new law that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the days prior to its passing warned, “<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/senators-demand-military-lock-american-citizens-battlefield-they-define-being" target="_blank">The Senate is going to vote on whether Congress will give this president—and every future president — the power to order the military to pick up and imprison without charge or trial civilians anywhere in the world. The power is so broad that even U.S. citizens could be swept up by the military and the military could be used far from any battlefield, even within the United States itself</a>.”

Most ominous in this FSB report is its stating that the “assassination regime” ordered against Ron Paul by Obama may already be underway as one of the US foreclosure fraud whistleblowers subpoenaed by Ron Paul to testify before the US Congress named Tracey Lawrence was found “<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/11/29/9099162-foreclosure-fraud-whistleblower-found-dead" target="_blank">suicided</a>” yesterday in Las Vegas.

The destruction of anyone found opposing the Obama regime and its bankster backers was, also, brought into sharp relief this week by the smearing by mental illness allegations of one of America’s top heroes <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://news.yahoo.com/marine-won-medal-honor-fights-allegations-mentally-unstable-171346866.html" target="_blank">US Marine Sergeant Dakota Meyer</a>, who in September received the Congressional Medal of Honor from Obama (who called him one of the most “down-to-earth guys that you will ever meet”) for saving the lives of 36 of his comrades, but after he alerted the press that his employer defense contractor BAE Systems was selling high-tech sniper rifles to Pakistan that are being used to kill America Soldiers was labeled as a “<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://news.yahoo.com/marine-won-medal-honor-fights-allegations-mentally-unstable-171346866.html" target="_blank">drunk and mentally ill</a>.”

So concerned has the Kremlin become about the growing American fascist police state it caused General Nikolai Makarov, Russia’s top military commander, to issue a warning to the West last week that the Motherland was <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.zimbabwemetro.com/?p=30650" target="_blank">fully prepared for a nuclear World War III</a> and which prompted the Obama regime to state that it would <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://news.yahoo.com/us-cease-observing-arms-treaty-russia-state-dept-205507881.html" target="_blank">immediately cease observing their arms treaty with Russia</a>.

To if the American people will be able to rally around Ron Paul before he is assassinated by the Obama regime it is not in our knowing, other than to note that in a country where every public demonstration – however peaceful and orderly it might be – is <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://lewrockwell.com/grigg/grigg-w237.html" target="_blank">ordered by their authorities to be treated as the equivalent of a prison riot</a>, where the former police chief of Seattle <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-15929017" target="_blank">blamed the militarization of local US police forces on Obama’s Homeland Security Department</a>, and where the media is described as being nothing more than a “lapdog” for Obama and his bankster allies, the likelihood of these people escaping the worst horrors to come do, indeed, seem inescapable.]]></content:encoded>

The fact that somebody scoffs at an article doesn't mean it isn't true.  I just looked at the Source and it's GlobalResearch.ca, which means something to me. I KNOW Michel Chossudovsky, and he can't afford to publish things that can be proven wrong: there are too many Zionists (B'nai Brith, 'Jewish Anti-Defamation League') breathing down his neck 24/7 trying to get him fired from his (University Professor) job. They would love nothing better than to NAIL him for publishing rumours.  His reputation is on the line with every piece they publish!
Just my 2 cents' worth........ :)

PS: After the videos of the Pro-Qaddafi megademonstrations in Tripoli with the huge strung-out Green Flags wee published, about a week later there were so many articles on the Net claiming that every participant had been paid $50,000 to demonstrate!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[No problem Sophie, discussion of what should or not be published as in reliable or not is of course part of the required discourse among editors. When reading, I felt it sounded a bit like "Sorcha Faal" from whatdoesitmean.com which credibility is unsure, and but guys, you are not checking sources properly --- indeed the language sounds like this and look see, the Global Research is NOT the source of the article. Click through to http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=27980 and see that it says there right at the top:

Global Research, December 1, 2011
The <a href="http://www.eutimes.net/" rel="nofollow">European Union Times</a> - 2011-11-30 and the EUT is a dubious "source" indeed and takes from "Sorcha Faal"... why would FSB be worried about internal American stuff... this is a disinfo op, quite possibly to turn real news into 'conspiracy' news, so that it becomes discredited. LOOK! Mathaba copied it from GlobalResearch, who copied it from EUtimes who copied it from whatdoesitmean.com and the "Sorcha Faal" who is likely an Israeli, and always seems to get all top level info from Russian intel for years, meaning Russian intel is full of holes and leakes everything via whatdoesitmean.com year after year, day after day? EUTimes.net is registered by an unknown "private" entity, why hide? As it whatdoesitmean.com. 

OH YES and my nose is right, at eutimes.net find the article, it is here: http://www.eutimes.net/2011/11/obama-issues-ron-paul-kill-order-as-russia-prepares-for-war/ and look at the bottom "Source" link leads to: http://www.whatdoesitmean.com/index1542.htm which now claims to be the "world's largest english language news service with 500 articles updated daily"... and who is the author, right there at the top, deliberately left out by the "more professional looking EUTimes.net"? 

By: Sorcha Faal, and as reported to her Western Subscribers 

Hmm....

So Auntie, GlobalResearch is making the same mistakes we used to make at mathaba many years ago, and it is also not following back the links to the real source, something we at least used to do when we posted items from whatdoesitmean.com on occasion years back.]]></wp:comment_content>

<em>At the end of the night always comes the dawn. The light at the end of the tunnel is Green like Freedom.</em>

We must not give up, even though we are surrounded by darkness; there is light at the end of the tunnel: it is a Green Light, it is the Light of Freedom!

These are sad days for the world, sad days for each of us: the economic crisis, unemployment, war and lack of democracy are factors that attack our lives.The easiest thing to do is to discourage ourselves and cry, <strong>but this would mean surrendering to the enemy and we will never do that!</strong>

The enemies of freedom just want to be able to do this: they want to demoralize and isolate us, they want to make us feel alone; but we are not alone, we are <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=627456" target="_blank">millions</a>.

The world is at war. Libya is just one of the battlefields. The war is among us, in Europe, America, Asia and Africa. This is a dirty war because it is hidden, it is an undeclared war. This war is made ​​by a few Masons who are masters of the world against millions of people. That's why the media slaves of "Free"masons do not talk about it: we are millions, they are 4 rats!

We must not ever forget this - <strong>we never walk alone.</strong>

As taught to us in the Great <a href="http://www.greencharter.com/files/gb.htm" target="_blank">Green Book</a> by our Great Brother Leader <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJURNC0e6Ek" target="_blank">Muammar Al Qadhafi</a> - <a href="http://peoplesconference.org/pc/" target="_blank">power belongs to the masses</a>, not to the Masons; the power is ours!

When they make us feel like slaves in our factories every day; when every day they choke us in their banks, increasing the interest of our mortgages, we must remember that we are not alone; when we struggle to get to the end of the month because they bleed us with their taxes (which are used to pay for the wars against us) we should not be ashamed; we should not cry; we are millions, we are not alone. This is their way of making war, this is their way of defending themselves against us; they are afraid of us because we are millions and they are few, old and vicious.

Today we are strong but we will be stronger when we are more united.<strong>The light is already present, you just turn it on. </strong>Our lights are the <strong><a href="http://www.greencharter.com/files/igc.htm" target="_blank">Green Charter Movement</a>. </strong>We must unite ourselves through <strong><a href="http://peoplesconference.org/pc/" target="_blank">People's Conferences</a>.</strong> We must create <strong><a href="http://www.greencharter.com/files/gcm.htm" target="_blank">(r)evolutionary committees</a></strong> in each of our cities. This is not a dream -  this is the light you see at the end of your tunnel, this is reality.

We are already so many but we must increase. Read the <strong>Green Book</strong> and spread it among your friends and acquaintances. Create a people's conference and register it on <a href="http://www.peoplesconference.org/">http://www.peoplesconference.org/</a>. Stay tuned on <a href="http://www.greencharter.com">www.greencharter.com</a> (Green Charter Movement is the union of all <a href="http://www.greencharter.com/files/gcm.htm" target="_blank">(r)evolutionary committees</a> of the world). Create your committee page on social networks. Stay informed at <a href="http://www.MATHABA.net">www.mathaba.net</a> (the "<a href="http://www.greencharter.com/files/mathaba.htm" target="_blank">headquarter</a>" of all Green movement - <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/donate.htm" target="_blank">support it</a>!); shout out democracy , shout out the truth!

The light at the end of the tunnel is Green like Freedom. It is up to all of us to run towards the light!

Russia: U.S.-NATO Missile Plans Upsets Global Balance Of Power

http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/12/01/61324148.html

Russian Information Agency Novosti
December 1, 2011

Russia’s response to US anti-missile program

Russia’s President Dmitry Medvedev believes the US plans for an anti-missile network in Europe violate the balance of power in the world.

Mr. Medvedev stated this when he and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin met with their supporters in Moscow, on the eve of parliamentary elections which will take place on Sunday.

Dmitry Medvedev announced that President Obama had said to him that he, Obama, did not intend to sign any documents which would officially confirm that the US anti-missile program in Europe was not aimed against Russia.

Thus, Russia has to take some kind of measures in response, Mr. Medvedev said. In particular, a radar station will be built in Kaliningrad, Russia’s westernmost city.

The Russian president also added that if Russia fails to reach an agreement with the US on the scale of the latter’s anti-missile program within the next 8 to 10 years, Russia will take other measures like deploying strategic offensive nuclear forces on its borders.

“However, we still have quite a lot of time to reach an agreement,” Mr. Medvedev concluded.

Brunssum trains PfP and Mediterranean Dialogue countries

-Students from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Finland, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and Jordan attend the course.
-JFC Brunssum, the Netherlands is one of three NATO operational level commands in NATO Allied Command Operations (ACO) and serves as the higher headquarters for ISAF in Afghanistan, with ISAF as a primary mission and NATO Article 5 Operational Planning, Baltic Air Policing, Military Cooperation and NATO Response Force (NRF) among other major activities. 

Monday, 21 November a Deployed Joint Forces Headquarters (DJF HQ) Training event started at NATO Allied Joint Force Command (JFC) Headquarters Brunssum.

Over two weeks 21 staff officers from 11 Partnership for Peace (PfP) countries and one Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) country will learn the principles of the DJF HQ (Deployable Joint Force Headquarters) organization with its latest updates.

“Jordan is part of the Mediterranean Dialogue with NATO, a partnership we greatly appreciate. Our armed forces participate in peacekeeping missions and this course provides me, as a battalion commander, necessary experience to work in an international environment,” Colonel Mekhled Suheim from Jordan said.

The training aims to prepare the participants to work as augmentees in a Deployable Joint Force Headquarters (DJF HQ) environment…

“As I’ve attended tactical level Partnership for Peace course in Sweden last year and participated in several exercises in France, Germany and in other countries, I came with the expectation to learn more on the NATO command structure and procedures at the operational level.

“I’m also looking forward to develop[ing] a full understanding on how NATO is transforming itself, as we in Switzerland are in the process of transforming our armed forces as well. I’m impressed by NATO’s experience to develop, as a constantly learning organisation, and how NATO is implementing its practical experience gained with operations such as ISAF, to its future planning,” Colonel Felix M. Huber from Switzerland added.

Based on an operational scenario, Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) guidance and UN resolutions, the staff officers had to develop their assessments and deliver situational awareness briefings.

Students from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Finland, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and Jordan attend the course.

Military Cooperation and outreach task aims to broaden and strengthen the Alliance by establishing enduring relationships and effective cooperation mechanisms with Partner Nations.

JFC Brunssum, the Netherlands is one of three NATO operational level commands in NATO Allied Command Operations (ACO) and serves as the higher headquarters for ISAF in Afghanistan, with ISAF as a primary mission and NATO Article 5 Operational Planning, Baltic Air Policing, Military Cooperation and NATO Response Force (NRF) among other major activities.

Pakistani Military Chief Gives Order To Retaliate Against NATO Attacks

Kayani declares war on ‘Nato aggressors’

ISLAMABAD: Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani on Thursday suspended the command and chain system to counter any aggression on borders.

Reliable sources said General Kayani suspended the command and chain system in order to enable the senior officers on the posts to take appropriate action if Pakistani forces come under attack. 

The Chief of the Army Staff issued these orders on Wednesday night according to which the Pakistani military officer in the area will be responsible for retaliation against any aggressors in that particular area and he will be provided all kind of assistance that he will ask for.

The sources further said the decision would, however, be applicable to eventualities involving NATO troops. The sources added that General Kayani also ordered troops to counter any aggression with full force and defend the motherland against any assailant and for that they do not need to wait for any orders from the high command.

He also said that the Pakistan Air Force should have taken action when NATO helicopters violated the Pakistani airspace and attacked Pakistani checkposts in Mohmand Agency last Saturday, the sources maintained. 

He further said the Air Force could not be called in as the communication system at the checkpost was destroyed in the Nato attack, the sources said.

Kayani ordered officers to utilise all resources at their disposal to give a befitting reply to the aggressors and they should not be spared.

The Army Chief also praised the jawans of the Azad Kashmir Regiment deployed at the border checkposts.

This was the first time after the occupation of Afghanistan by allied forces that a Pakistani army chief, fed up with continuous border aggression, has issued such orders.

Kayani’s bold move: ‘Pakistani troops will return fire if Nato attacks again’
By Kamran Yousaf

“The focus of forces at the Afghan border was to take action against militants…but now they will also be keeping an eye on future Nato strikes,” Brig (retd) Mehmood Shah.

ISLAMABAD: In a development that pushes US-Pakistan relations further into the realm of uncertainty, the army has authorised its local commanders deployed near the Afghan border to retaliate against any future incursions by Nato forces.

The decision to review the chain of command of security forces stationed at the western border was taken by the army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, after consultations with his top commanders in the wake of Nato strikes on the weekend, said a military official.

The change means that from here on in the US-led Nato forces in Afghanistan will also be treated as a potential threat, commented former Federal Administered Tribal Areas secretary Brig (retd) Mehmood Shah.

“Until now the focus of security forces at the Afghan border was to take action against militants and stop cross border infiltration but now they will also be keeping an eye on future Nato strikes,” Brig Shah added.

Defence analyst Lt General (Retd) Abdul Qayum was of the view that local commanders will now not have to seek approval from their chain of command to return fire at Nato fighter planes if they carry out “hostile manoeuvres on our soil.”

The fresh directives have been conveyed by General Kayani in a letter circulated among the concerned military quarters.

Another military official disclosed that a proposal is under consideration to re-equip the troops along the border with Afghanistan to stop any future violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty.

If Nato forces refuse to give firm guarantees to stop incursions, the security forces may be deployed on the eastern border (Indian border) where they will have the necessary airpower to thwart any misadventure, the official added.

However, the latest move is being seen by many as an attempt by the military brass to pacify the growing anger among the lower-cadre of the army over the Nato strikes and also use it as pressure tactic.

Pakistan: China Expresses Strong Concern Over NATO Attack

http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=80485&Cat=2

News International
December 2, 2011

‘China concerned over Nato attack’

LAHORE: China has expressed strong concern over the Nato attack on innocent Pakistani soldiers. It has also condemned the attack while condoling with the people of Pakistan over the tragic loss.

These views were expressed by an 11-member delegation of Chinese diplomats, led by Ms Ma Keqing, ambassador/executive deputy secretary of the CPC committee of Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with Punjab Governor Latif Khosa at Governor’s House here on Thursday.

Ms Ma Keqing reiterated her country’s resolve to continue supporting Pakistan’s point of view on every issue related to its integrity and sovereignty.

Speaking on the occasion, the governor said Pakistan and China were enjoying complete trust and similar views on all bilateral, regional and international issues. He said the people of Pakistan had strong belief in the time-tested friendship of China because China had always helped and supported Pakistan in crises and natural calamities. 

Khosa further maintained that Pakistan had always shown its unequivocal and complete support for China’s core interest, including its stand on Tibet and Taiwan. Pakistan’s strategic partnership with China would remain the cornerstone of Pakistanís foreign policy.

U.S.-China: Arms Race In The Pacific

U.S.-China: arms race in the Pacific
Alexander Vatutin

The Chinese Foreign Ministry described the U.S. growing military presence in the Pacific “a return to the Cold War strategy”. The announcement came following an agreement signed between Washington and Canberra to station up to 2,500 U.S. marines in Australia’s northern city of Darwin.
Analysts draw out attention to a key trend in the growing military confrontation in the Pacific: the stronger the Chinese economy is and the faster it carries out its military reforms, the stronger is the U.S. presence in the Pacific. No doubt, the two super powers are entering a new phase of strategic confrontation.

While the role of the US Navy in the region is rather symbolic as far as the implementation of obligations given to allies is concerned, the US presence in the Strait of Malacca allows them to control the delivery of the Mideast oil to the Pacific region. This strait is also a route to deliver commercial goods from the Pacific to the Middle East. Neither has the U.S. plans to reduce its military personnel in the western part of the Pacific. These are 80,000 troops stationed in Japan and 28,000 in South Korea.

It is worth mentioning that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is visiting Myanmar these days, which is the  first official visit of a top US diplomat to this country since 1955. The visit was organized immediately after Myanmar authorities showed their intention to start democratic reforms. Analysts say, however, that the main aim of Mrs. Clinton`s visit is to demonstrate to China that its interests in Myanma differ from those of the U.S.

During his recent visit to the region, Pentagon chief Leon Panetta said that the U.S. was planning to increase its presence there. He said that his country`s strategy was to offer a counterbalance against China`s ‘affirmative action’ policy, the words used to describe Beijing`s growing territorial disputes with neighbors and its increased military spending. 

Military expert Viktor Baranets comments:

“China has been intensively increasing its military presence in land and sea areas, and even in space. China bought a Russian aircraft carrier and has already given it its first sea trials, thus evoking great concern in the U.S. Actually, the U.S. presence in the region is weakening gradually and is likely to exist on equal terms with China.

Military analyst Vladimir Yevseev thinks that this competition may trigger an armed conflict in the area.

The 2012 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit will be held in Russia’s city of Vladivostok. Moscow says that an arms race in the Pacific will be among key issues on the agenda.

China calls for cool heads in Kosovo
By Xi Laiwang and Wu Yun 

-Serbia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 is an important legal basis to solve issues pertaining to Kosovo. 

Li Baodong, the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, said in his speech to the U.N. Security Council on Nov. 29 that China is concerned over the continued tension in northern Kosovo. 

Li stressed that all parties should fully understand the situation in the region, including its sensitivity and complexity. Li said all involved should handle the differences through dialogue and negotiations while avoiding actions that may escalate tensions.

The situation in Kosovo is crucial to the peace and stability of the Balkan region and the rest of Europe as well, Li said. Serbia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244 is an important legal basis to solve issues pertaining to Kosovo. 

Furthermore, the issue should be resolved within the framework of the U.N. Security Council resolutions, and through dialogue, consultation, negotiation and other peaceful means.

NATO’s Angels Of Death

Nato’s angels of death
By M. A. Niazi

The firing by Nato helicopters on a Pakistani check post, killing no less than 24 Pakistani soldiers, has created even more difficulties in a troubled relationship, and should have helped bring home to the USA’s friends in government that the massacre took place because of the country’s participation in America’s war on terror. 

The Pakistani government, both its elected component and the permanent bureaucracy, are doing their best to repair the relationship, but the USA has been used to cheap repairs. 

There is a precedent: the Nato helicopter attack last year, which led Pakistan to suspend the supply route to Afghanistan, but it reopened on receipt of an apology. It seems that the Pakistani and American sides are presently negotiating a price. That is an unstable basis for a relationship that is supposed to be as broad as the USA claims it has with Pakistan. 

However, it is, perhaps, illustrative that the rulers in Islamabad consider the relationship they enjoy with the USA as outweighing the lives of Pakistani soldiers.

Pakistani soldiers, too, need to consider what they are getting into. The attack is the second, and, probably, will not be the last. The apologies, if at all they come, will bring no soldiers back to life. 

There is also the question of how far the alliance, which is supposed to be directed against the terrorists, actually does so. After all, it now seems that the USA, whose helicopters did the killing, is trying to play catch-up in the number of Pakistani armed forces personnel killed. The armed forces are thus involved in a two-front war, both against the militants and their supposed allies. If the Indian threat is factored in, it becomes a three-way threat the armed forces are faced with, and which they must act against. The angst among the public is because there is a realisation that this is an impossible task.

Be that as it may, the story that the USA has initially come up with merely feeds into American prejudices, of Nato helicopters firing on militants fleeing to a Pakistani check post for protection, thus proving, once again, that Pakistanis are providing support to Al-Qaeda and the Taliban. 

That the story is untrue, more so, raises the possibility of the USA trying to send a message to Pakistan, such as the implacability of its hostility, once it regards Pakistan as a hostile State. The catch in that is that the USA’s basis of remaining in Afghanistan – the Karzai regime – is weak and could collapse at any time. It certainly does not control the border territories, which are known as Yaghestan, and are as inhospitable on the Afghan side of the Durand Line as on the Pakistani, and where the incident occurred.

The USA at least has conceded that Pakistan has a large number of dead soldiers on its hands, and should realise, as it must have, since it has not yet made the claim, that the local commander is at fault. For this to happen, there should have been a multiple failure, all along the chain of command, of the information that Pakistani check posts were not to be fired at. 

Thus, Pakistanis pointing the finger at the Isaf Commander, and the US general commanding its forces in Afghanistan, are justified. However, blaming him leads to an even more frightening prospect: The general is in constant touch with the political leadership, both of Nato, through its Secretary General, and of the USA, through both its Defence Secretary and President. However, there is a catch: The Isaf Commander is an American general, and will only take covert instructions from the President, not from Nato. Either he received instructions, or he thinks the US President too weak to harm him. The incumbent, General John Allen, might remember that his predecessor’s predecessor, General Stanley McChrystal, was sacked for being disrespectful to the President, and might have calculated that Obama would not like to sack another commander in Afghanistan.

Two Pakistanis ‘killed by NATO’ in Afghanistan

QUETTA: Two Pakistanis were gunned down by NATO forces in Bibi Jan area, a bordering area of Afghanistan on Thursday. Balochistan Levies confirmed the incident by saying that two Pakistani were shot dead in Afghanistan in Helmand on Thursday morning. 

According to sources, the two men went to visit their relatives living in the Brabcha area inside Afghanistan from Chagai when NATO forces opened fire on them, killing both instantly. They were identified as Abdullah and Muhammad Usman, residents of the Chagai district. 

According to the spokesperson of Frontier Corps (FC), the firing incident took place inside Afghanistan. Separately, seven Pakistani workers have been kidnapped in an area troubled by the Taliban near the Afghan capital Kabul, police said Thursday. The Pakistanis – engineers and workers assigned to a hospital construction project in Logar province – were returning to their accommodation after work when they were snatched at gunpoint on Wednesday. “They were going home from work. Along the road, their minivan was stopped by unidentified gunmen, their driver was forced out of the car and all were taken away to an undisclosed location,” Logar police chief Ghulam Sakhi Roghliwani said. The abduction comes as Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan and the United States are at a low after NATO killed 24 Pakistani troops on Saturday.

China welcomes Pak-Russia’s candid relations 

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is China’s best friend internationally secondly to Russia, said Professor Zhou Rong, Chief of South Asia Bureau of the Guang Ming Daily of China. Speaking at a roundtable discussion organized by the Institute of Regional Studies here on Thursday, he maintained that China would welcome an improvement of the relationship between its two best friends. 

He argued that since India had become a world sought-after country and was gravitating towards the US, the Russians would also be interested in mending fences with the Pakistanis…

He cautioned against the Pak-US relationship being based on incongruent and at times divergent interests.

Afghanistan: Attack On NATO Bases Kills One, Injures 70

NATO base blast: 1 dead, up to 70 injured in Afghanistan

-“Although there’s an argument that President Obama and his team are now moving towards an aerial-based security policy where they will have only counter-terrorism through drones and through helicopters, and that they don’t really want people on the ground occupying countries for a long time, the reality is that the Pentagon is pushing for the same old strategy where they hunker down and stay there for as long as they can.”

A suicide bomber attack at the NATO coalition base in the Afghan Logar province has left at least 1 person dead and up to 70 injured.

The attacker used an explosive-laden truck to set off a powerful explosion just outside the entrance to the base on Friday morning, local authorities reported.

The majority of those wounded are civilians, Logar’s health director, Mohammad Zarif Nayebkhail told AFP. Seven of the wounded are Afghan security guards from the base. Atiqullah Ludin, the local governor, said the deceased victim was an Afghan carpenter. 

…

In September, 77 US troops were wounded in a truck bombing which targeted a NATO base in Wardak province, which borders Logar. US officials blamed the attack on the Haqqani network, an Afghan Taliban faction, which Washington says has strong ties with Pakistan.

There are currently 140,000 international troops in Afghanistan. The number is set to decrease by the end of 2014, but a substantial presence is expected to remain in an effort to train Afghan security forces.

Sreeram Chaulia, professor at the Jindal School of International Affairs, believes the US is likely to stay on in Afghanistan even after 2014, now that relations with Pakistan have been rapidly going downhill.

“Although there’s an argument that President Obama and his team are now moving towards an aerial-based security policy where they will have only counter-terrorism through drones and through helicopters, and that they don’t really want people on the ground occupying countries for a long time, the reality is that the Pentagon is pushing for the same old strategy where they hunker down and stay there for as long as they can,” Chaulia said to RT. “So this is going to mean that even after 2014, and especially this rancor between the US and Pakistan will mean, that it will become a justification for the United States to stay on much longer.”

Persian Gulf: Washington Arming Anti-Iran Coalition

http://rt.com/news/us-anti-iran-coalition-799/

RT
December 1, 2011

Is Washington arming anti-Iran coalition?

The Pentagon is selling 4,900 smart-bomb kits to the United Arab Emirates in what many see as a move to equip an armed military bloc against Iran. Meanwhile, the EU is cutting all diplomatic channels with the troublesome country.

­The Pentagon has addressed Congress over a large arms deal with the UAE worth some $304 million. The proposed arms package will allow the UAE to convert its unguided bombs into high-accuracy missiles. 

At least 600 of the bombs to be converted are of the hard-target penetrator class also known as “bunker-busters,” which are capable of penetrating two meters of concrete-steel constructions.

The Pentagon sees the deal as a chance to “improve the UAE’s capability to meet current and future regional threats.” The upgraded weaponry would give the country “one of the most capable air forces in the region, thereby serving US interests by deterring regional aggression,” its Wednesday statement said.

The United Arab Emirates already has a fleet of F-16 fighters capable of carrying those bombs. Moreover, it already has several hundred smart missiles in stock that were earlier supplied by the US.

The UAE is a major purchaser of US weapons, but it is not the only one in the region. According to media reports Washington is actively arming other Middle East countries such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait to build a unified counterweight to Iran.

Iran’s nuclear program is clearly unacceptable to the US and its allies. But a direct military strike is something that seemed a measure of last resort until recently.

Speculation about the US forming a Middle East coalition is growing amid concerns that Iran is becoming a diplomatic outcast as European countries recall their ambassadors to Iran one by one.

Barricade in the village of Jagnjenica (Tanjug)

KOSOVSKA MITROVICA: Even though President Boris Tadić called for removal of barricades, northern Kosovo Serbs have built three new barricades in the village of Jagnjenica. 

A barricade in the village of Dudin Krš has been reinforced. 

Daily Politika writes that the local Serbs are keeping watch at all 19 barricades in northern Kosovo. 

…

Northern Kosovo Serbs “disappointed” in Tadić

The northern Kosovo Serbs are disappointed by Tadić’s call to remove the barricades, Zubin Potok Mayor Slaviša Ristić said on Wednesday. Kosovska Mitrovica Mayor Krstimir Pantić has said that the call is confusing and that he believes that it is a result of pressure from Brussels. 

They told Politika that they would call an emergency joint session of four northern Kosovo Serb municipalities on Thursday in order to discuss the president’s request. 

Daily Danas, on the other hand, writes that the northern Kosovo Serbs are ready for alternative resistance measures if the government decided to implement some temporary measures against them. The daily has learned that criminal charges against Belgrade team chief Borislav Stefanović will be filed by the local Serb representatives as soon as details about today’s talks with Priština in Brussels are made public. 

The daily also added that the northern Kosovo Serb representatives will most likely request a parliament session so the MPs could discuss a change of the state policy which was announced by Tadić.

Department of State: U.S. supports Turkmenistan’s initiatives to ensure energy security
H. Hasanov 

Turkmenistan, Ashgabat: The U.S. supports Turkmenistan’s initiative on ensuring global energy security, U.S. Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs Robert Blake said in Ashgabat, the Turkmen government said on Thursday.

Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdimuhammadov received the senior U.S. official.

The U.S. diplomat said that the U.S. supports Turkmenistan’s international initiatives aimed at seeking optimal solutions to urgent problems, ensuring global energy security.

In particular, Blake stressed that “United States appreciates the leadership of Turkmenistan in ensuring stability and sustainable development in the Central Asian region and, in particular, on supporting the socio-economic reconstruction of Afghanistan”.

He also said that “the U.S. government welcomes Ashgabat’s leading role in promoting the project of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline”.

At the same time “huge importance of the transnational project, designed to become a reliable link between the states of the region, to promote their effective economic integration…” was stressed.

The Asian Development Bank actively promotes this project funding the preparation of its feasibility study.

The basic document to advance the TAPI project is an inter-state agreement to start implementation of the TAPI, signed at a high level in Ashgabat in December 2010.

At this stage, the parties interested in the project agree on the security of transit and decide issues of funding and fuel prices.

The length of TAPI can hit more than 1,700 km, its design capacity 33 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year. The cost is estimated at $7-8 billion.

The source of raw materials in addition to the Dovletabad field will be Yoloten field, one of the world’s super-giants with reserves of 21.2 trillion cubic meters of gas…

The report also says that Blake conveyed U.S. President Barack Obama’s and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s greetings, as well as congratulations on the upcoming 20th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations between Turkmenistan and the United States.

As Blake said “the U.S. attaches great importance to developing cooperation with Turkmenistan, which is a reliable, responsible and long-term partner”.

TAP keen to provide cost-effective delivery of Azerbaijani gas to Europe
A. Badalova

-The TAP is a natural gas pipeline project intended to transport gas from the Caspian region via Greece and Albania and across the Adriatic Sea to southern Italy and further into western Europe. The project is aimed at enhancing security of supply as well as diversification of gas supplies [displacing Russian gas] for the European markets.

Azerbaijan, Baku: The Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) is keen to ensure the safe and cost-effective transport of Azerbaijani Shah Deniz gas to European countries, as well as to support Greece to assume its role as a key European energy player, Natural Gas Europe reported referring to a TAP official.

“TAP has all the credentials allowing it to uphold and fulfill its commitment, which has been very consistent from the beginning of this project,” External Affairs and Communications Director for TAP, Michael Hoffmann, said in an interview to Natural Gas Europe.

According to Hoffmann, TAP has many advantages over the current competition with other pipeline projects, the most critical of which is the scalability of the pipeline.

At the moment the gas which will be produced during the second stage of Azerbaijani Shah Deniz gas field development is considered as the main available source for the projects within the Southern gas Corridor.

It is therefore logical to develop the pipeline in line with the Shah Deniz schedule, to be ready when they are ready, Hoffmann believes.

However, he believes that there will be additional volume in the future. So, one needs a pipeline that can be easily scalable to provide much larger throughput.

“TAP is the only pipeline which can meet this specific requirement,” Hoffmann said.

TAP’s initial pipeline capacity will be 10 billion cubic meters per year, while it has full scalability to 20 bcm.

…

The TAP is a natural gas pipeline project intended to transport gas from the Caspian region via Greece and Albania and across the Adriatic Sea to southern Italy and further into western Europe. The project is aimed at enhancing security of supply as well as diversification of gas supplies for the European markets.

The total length of the pipeline is about 800 kilometers.

TAP’s shareholders are EGL of Switzerland (42.5 percent), Norway’s Statoil (42.5 percent) and E.ON Ruhrgas of Germany (15 percent).

On Oct. 1, TAP along with the other pipeline projects (Nabucco, ITGI) submitted their final proposals to the Azerbaijani side, which review them in accordance with previously announced criteria.

Clinton In Myanmar: All About China

Clinton in Myanmar: All about China?

====
Video
====

The US Secretary of State is on the first official visit to Myanmar in 50 years, seen as an effort to push for democratic reforms. But experts believe the true aim of the trip is to pressure China and weaken its influence in the Asia-Pacific region.

­The visit follows a decision by President Barack Obama in late November to open the door to the politically-isolated country, following recent progress in terms of political and economic reforms by the ruling military.

Pavin Chachavalpongpun from the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore believes the timing of the visit could not have been better taking into account a number of concessions by Myanmar’s new government. 

“If we look back, during the past five to eight months Myanmar has done drastic change domestically, especially in terms of pushing for more reforms,” he told RT. “We saw the elections last year in November, after that we also saw the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the opposition from the NLD [National League for Democracy]. For the past few months we have seen the release of political prisoners and even a decision to suspend a project with China on a dam. These are key developments in Myanmar, so this is why I think it is a very crucial timing, especially when Myanmar has been awarded the chairmanship of ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asia Nations], which will be in 2014. It could not be a better time.”

Myanmar, known as Burma until 1989, is under US and international sanctions, a situation which gave its neighbor China an opportunity to extend its influence. The country is now experiencing an unusual diplomatic revival.

­Washington has sought to isolate Burma since the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) came to power in 1988. In 1990 the US withdrew its ambassador from the country, following the annulment of election results…

On Monday, Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping proposed that China and Myanmar bolster military cooperation during a meeting with Myanmar’s Commander of the Armed Forces. Min Aung Hlaing visited China with a two-day visit earlier this week, just before the trip by the US Secretary of State 

Commenting on the US diplomatic efforts, Pavin Chachavalpongpun says the true aim of Hillary Clinton’s visit to Naypyidaw is to trim down Beijing’s growing dominance in the region.

“If we look into a larger geopolitical context, this is about competition with the rise of China in this part of the world, especially in Myanmar,” he told RT. “At least this has shown the Chinese that what we have seen in Myanmar – being an isolated country heavily relying on China alone – is no longer true. I think Myanmar has reached out to other powers from outside the region, as much as in the region, for example, to India, to ASEAN and other organizations. And now towards the US. I think, from Myanmar perspective, this is kind of diversifying its own foreign policy options. So I think China will have to bear this in mind. This is in the interest of the US government to have to come and to have to maintain its strategic alliance with a country in this region.”

­The only other US secretary of state to visit Myanmar was John Foster Dulles – in 1955 to then-Burma. 

Two years earlier, in 1953 US Vice President Richard Nixon made a two-day visit to Burma. 

The US then tried to bring Burma into the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, a planned Southeast Asian version of NATO. The US-backed organization aimed to block the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, but it did not last long and was dissolved in 1977 after multiple members lost interest and withdrew.

Nixon was greeted by demonstrators carrying anti-US signs with such slogans as: “Burma not a place for Yankee warmongers” and “Uncle Sam out!”

­Dr. Pak-nung Wong from the Chinese University of Hong Kong explained to RT why China regards Clinton’s visit as a possible threat to its strategic interests in the region.

“This threat is posed from two angles,” he said. “Number one: China has been contributing more than 70 per cent of foreign direct investment to Myanmar. And if the US is able to open up Myanmar and bring in more Western capital, that means Myanmar would have more opportunities and more bartering power to try to level the dominance and the influence of Chinese investors and capital as a result. So the Chinese government is seeing this visit as an opening of more unpredictability in the Myanmar market”.

“Number two,” he went on, “it is bringing more uncertainly regarding regional security. China has been importing more than 80 per cent of its oil through the Malacca Strait which is a choke point between Indonesia and Singapore. China has been working closely with Myanmar to build a pipeline from the coastal port of Kyaukryu directly to the Chinese city of Kunming. And that project has been very smooth in the past. However, the visit of Clinton and opening up Myanmar to Western countries may pose certain insecurity and uncertainty to this particular project.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

Right on cue two days before Russia’s Parliamentary elections, comes SKY News. Are they following terrorists, interviewing rapists, glorifying murderers and taking sides? Are they asking Americans in Iraq if they are looking for revenge for 9/11? Why no, they are muck-raking in Russia’s vast interior, painting a negative image of Vladimir Putin.

In the sewer where the British media resides, pride of place in this festering cesspit alongside the British Bullshit Corporation must be reserved for SKY News, where lies on SKY abound, where stories are turned around or upside down, where gross manipulation rules the day and where insinuation goes hand in hand with reporting what are supposed to be facts.

So where does SKY News turn up in Russia two days before the election? In a nice, refurbished, modernised interior city in Russia’s vast hinterland? In a village which has had a new plant built bringing jobs and prosperity? No, in remote districts of Kurgan, where SKY found a few buildings with crumbling walls, a 40-year-old lady who is already a grandmother, who turned on the tears as SKY revealed an “Ahhhh! Factor” shot of a baby sleeping in a cot, covered in a blanket to avoid the mosquitoes “breeding underground” before switching to a “wow ! factor” shot of the Governor’s residence to create a nice contrast. Kind of like showing a snapshot of a tramp lying in a pool of urine on Victoria station and then a clip of the Chancellor of the Exchequer jetting off to Klosters for his skiing holiday.

This, complete with aggressive and unacceptable soundbites such as referring to Russia’s Prime Minister Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin as “Putin” and quotes from obscure Just Russia opposition supporters saying that United Russia is, and I quote: "the party of swindlers and thieves".

Interesting because in 2007, United Russia swept to a massive and thumping election victory with figures that would astonish leaders like Cameron (whose name rhymes with “moron”) or his nasty little side-kick in the Foreign Office, Hague, that bald-pated slap-head whose name rhymes with “plague”. In 2007, United Russia won the election with 64.3% of the vote, won 315 out of the 450 seats in the DUMA and 2,838 out of 3,785 seats in regional parliaments.
Through the perfectly natural process of political image-wasting it is natural that United Russia will not garner quite such a hefty slice of the vote four years on, which is expectable and healthy but one thing is sure: United Russia will be confirmed as Russia’s most popular party, and by far, in Sunday’s election, ahead of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation which should come in second. Way, way behind United Russia will be SKY’s darlings such as Just Russia.

Let us look at the latest opinion polls coming out of Russia (a compilation of several polls taken recently across the country): In first place we have Dmitry Medvedev’s United Russia (Vladimir Putin will fight for the Presidential election in March 2012) with 40%; in second, Gennady Zyuganov’s Communist Party of the Russian Federation (11%); third Vladimir Zhirinovsky’s Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (9.5%), fourth Sergey Mironov’s Just Russia (8.5%); fifth, sixth and seventh on one per cent apiece, Yabloko (led by Grigory Yavlinsky), Patriots of Russia (Gennadi Semigin) and Right Cause (Andrei Dunaev).

That just about takes the wind out of SKY’s sails, does it not? Did the Party of Camoron and Hague the Plague win with a percentage lead four times that of the second most voted political Party, Labour? And now we are muck-raking, let us take a quick look around Britain, shall we?

The last time I visited Camoron and Hague the Plague’s country, I was shocked. I was waved through passport control by an obese gentleman with his stomach hanging out of his shirt who did not appear to speak English, whereupon I was interviewed by a lady in a veil who I could not understand very well, who called a gentleman in a turban who I understood less well, who in turn called a young Caucasian English-born spotty-faced youth who I could not understand at all. The spoken English language has disappeared – what you get today is gabbling and grunts; “water” is now “wor’a”, “seventeen” is “sivin’oin”, “Excuse me, sir!” has become “Oi!! Moi’(t)!” (without the T).

The train which took me to central London was bedecked with graffiti of the most inane kind – Tosha sucks c***, Kevin sh*ts – and the floor was invisible because it was covered with a sea of fast food packages and, from the smell, far worse festering thereunder. Indeed, it appeared that Kevin really does. From what I could see, the hotels in London are overpriced flea-pits complete with alien pubic hairs on the sheets and in my case a toilet that did not flush complete with a noisy air-conditioning unit outside the window which appeared to be competing with a faulty jet engine.

A visit to the countryside is, in a word, a challenge. Spread across the train seats with his boots on those opposite, is a sivin’oin-year-old “Kevin”, no doubt living with a “Tosha” who refuses to shift after a polite request. “Oim si’in ‘ere, si’ somewhere fakkin’ euse”. It did move, and very fast, when I removed my dark glasses and it observed what was lunging behind my eyes. The journey was punctuated by the most disgusting swear words bawled from the throats of screaming Toshas and Kevins on a raucous school trip, the teachers accompanying them cringing in embarrassed silence and when I arrived at my destination, I flinched and groaned spontaneously in amazement. The station platform looked as if the inhabitants of all the pigsties in the surrounding area had been kettled into it for a week and smelt even worse. Swear words had been scrawled in excrement across the station walls in what looked like a perfect mix between a war zone and a public latrine.

One quarter of all families in England and one third of those in Wales are classified as living in fuel poverty, I saw plenty of houses in ruin, I met plenty of people living in abject misery, I heard hundreds of complaints from people who saw themselves in an eternal cycle of unemployment and saw no future for their children. Ninety-five per cent of English schoolkids, it seems, come out of school after thirteen years unable to spot the difference between “its” and “it’s”, mental arithmetic appears to be rocket science, writing skills are three lines full of spelling and grammar mistakes. Moving from the education to the health ministry, patients are terrified of going to hospital because they say they are far more likely to pick up an infection there and come out worse than when they went in. Not that good so far, is it? See how easy it is to go around finding trouble?

Almost everyone I spoke to accused the governing class of being more interested in feathering their own nests and of having lost touch with reality, strong on soundbites and weak on policy, more likely to be found wearing a suspender belt in an underground apartment near the House of Commons spending time with Spanking Sarah and a feather duster than in their Constituencies working.

Back to SKY News. This afternoon, this illustrious channel called in an ex-diplomat called Charles Crawford, who will be an international observer of the Russian Parliamentary elections on Sunday and who stated “I think there is Twitter in Russia”. That just about sums up the British media, SKY News and puerile and slanted takes on Russia, does it not?

Vladimir Putin does not go around the world starting wars, printing flags and supporting terrorists, thieves, torturers, arsonists and rapists, murdering women and children. He represents the rule of law and not the jungle, he represents a multilateral approach to crisis management and the use of the UNSC as the proper forum for debate and discussion and dialogue and not as a body to rubber-stamp NATO’s murderous and greedy schemes. He represents sustained prosperity and improvement of the standard of living for the vast majority of Russians, he is a patriot, he cares for Russia and the interests of Russian people, he is the right man in the right place at the right time.

That is why he will be elected President in March with a huge majority of the vote, that is why United Russia will appear on Sunday by far as the largest party in a free and fair democratic election. Sure, SKY News will insinuate that there were irregularities but then again, what do Tosha and Kevin do? Eh what?]]></content:encoded>

<em>Os mais recentes sucessos iranianos são reforçados pela descoberta e desmontagem de uma cadeia de espionagem da CIA que operava dentro do grupo Hezbollah no Líbano.</em>

<strong> Por Mahan Abedin
<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/ML01Ak01.html" target="_blank">Asia Times Online</a></strong>
<strong>Tradução: Vila Vudu</strong>

A prisão de 12 espiões que trabalhavam para a CIA-EUA, anunciada recentemente pelas autoridades iranianas, pode vir a revelar-se muito duro golpe contra os esforços da agência norte-americana que busca coletar informações sobre o Irã e, no geral, contra toda inteligência dos EUA. Essas prisões recentes acontecem imediatamente depois da prisão, em maio passado, de outros 30 suspeitos de também trabalharem para a CIA; e indicam que o Irã já conta com importantes capacidades de contrainteligência.

Os mais recentes sucessos iranianos são reforçados pela descoberta e desmontagem de uma cadeia de espionagem da CIA que operava dentro do grupo Hezbollah no Líbano. Todas essas notícias já foram confirmadas, muito a contragosto, por atuais e antigos funcionários da inteligência dos EUA – o que sugere fortemente que se trate, sim, de grave derrota da inteligência dos EUA, ou, mesmo, de desastre de grandes proporções.

Recentes sucessos da contrainteligência do Hezbollah contra Israel e EUA (em junho, o Hezbollah prendeu dois espiões da CIA que trabalhavam infiltrados na organização) são outros bons resultados devidos, pelo menos em parte, à crescente colaboração que o Hezbollah tem recebido da contrainteligência iraniana.

Fontes do jornal Asia Times Online em Teerã dizem que, nos últimos meses, o Ministério de Inteligência e Segurança do Irã [ing.Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS)] tem-se mostrado mais disposto a partilhar técnicas e know-how extremamente sensíveis de contraespionagem, com o Hezbollah e com os serviços oficiais da inteligência do Líbano.

Quanto à prisão, no Irã, dos 12 suspeitos de espionar a serviço da CIA, além de ser indicação clara da escalada de missões clandestinas da inteligência dos EUA dentro do Irã, há duas observações necessárias. Primeira: é patente que a CIA opera hoje sob baixos padrões de qualidade, seja no recrutamento seja na gestão de seu pessoal. Segunda: há sinais de que o Ministério de Inteligência e Segurança do Irã já está conseguindo converter o Irã em espaço inacessível aos serviços de inteligência estrangeiros hostis.

Informação obtida de muitas fontes na imprensa iraniana – e confirmada por fontes de Asia Times Online em Teerã – sugere que a CIA estaria operando sem objetivo claro (‘atire para todos os lados’), e recolhendo informação de praticamente qualquer cidadão.

Em maio, circularam notícias de que haveria “operadores” do governo entre os suspeitos de espionagem então presos; agora, o ministro da Inteligência do Irã Heydar Moslehi já disse a jornalistas locais, no domingo, que não há funcionários do governo entre os 12 novos suspeitos de espionagem presos.

Falando dos bastidores da reunião semanal do Gabinete, Moslehi deu fortes indícios de que muitos, se não todos os presos recentes são ou jovens cientistas ou estudantes de famílias abastadas que viajam frequentemente ao exterior, em viagens de estudos ou para congressos e seminários científicos.

Informação que se encontra em muitos veículos da mídia iraniana ao longo dos últimos seis meses – e também confirmada por fontes de Asia Times Online em Teerã – parece indicar que, além do alvo principal (o programa nuclear iraniano e o establishmentde defesa do país), a CIA opera também conta outros alvos dentro do Irã: o sistema bancário e financeiro iraniano; as redes de logística e transporte (principalmente transporte aéreo); o planejamento urbano; o setor de petróleo e gás; e a indústria desoftwares, principalmente empresas privadas que criam e operam os programas especialistas usados dentro do governo iraniano.

Mais especificamente, a CIA parece interessada em descobrir e entender como o Irã está conseguindo contornar e superar as sanções internacionais e unilaterais impostas por EUA e países europeus; como e em que extensão o Irã está usando o sistema financeiro internacional para manter em andamento vários projetos críticos, e os negócios do dia-a-dia da vida do país; vulnerabilidades que haja na rede logística e de transportes; os níveis de prontidão e preparo das organizações iranianas de socorro humanitário e resposta a emergências; e, em termos mais gerais, a resistência da infraestrutura iraniana crítica que esteja disponível para operar no país no caso de grande desastre ou longo período de estresse (como, evidentemente, se o país for militarmente atacado).

Para alcançar esses objetivos, o Serviço Nacional Clandestino [ing. National Clandestine Service (NCS)] da CIA criou uma equipe dedicada de operadores e analistas, que trabalham, basicamente, em países que têm fronteiras com o Irã, mas também mais longe, especialmente em países onde vivam número significativo de estudantes iranianos, como a Malásia.

Essa rede dedicada é excepcionalmente bem treinada. Por exemplo, todos esses agentes de campo e analistas têm de ser falantes super eficientes da língua persa e ter competências de alto nível nas ‘trocas interculturais’.

Há sinais de que a CIA-EUA começou a construir essa vasta rede dedicada em 2003; e em meados de 2008, a maioria dos agentes já estavam em campo. Tudo isso ajuda a ver a extensão e a importância dos recentes sucessos da contrainteligência do Irã, a qual, agora, já expôs, neutralizou e tornou inócuos praticamente todo o gigantesco aparato e vastos investimentos da contrainteligência da CIA-EUA no país.

Ao longo das investigações e trabalho especializado de contraespionagem, o Ministério de Inteligência e Segurança do Irã diz já ter identificado 42 oficiais do NCS-CIA que trabalham em vários países e já ter recolhido informação detalhada sobre o objetivo e a natureza de seu trabalho.

As equipes desse serviço NCS-CIA parecem trabalhar embutidas em várias organizações oficiais e não oficiais dos EUA, como embaixadas dos EUA, corporações multinacionais, organizações comerciais de porte médio, consultorias e empresas de recrutamento de empregados, serviços de imigração e outros serviços oficiais mais amplos, em universidades e instituições para-acadêmicas de renome, e em institutos, think tanks e empresas menos conhecidas.

Se se pode crer em matérias distribuídas pela imprensa online iraniana, a obsessão com cientistas e estudantes iranianos de ciências pode ter sido o calcanhar de Aquiles da operação, a partir do qual toda a operação pôde ser desmontada. Já se sugeriu que a existência de uma rede de 30 pessoas e suas sub-redes, já desmanteladas no início desse ano (anúncio feito no final de maio) chamou a atenção das autoridades iranianas graças a informações prestadas voluntariamente por um estudante iraniano que suspeitou, ao ser abordado por uma instituição para-acadêmica (que lhe ofereceu bolsas de estudo e dinheiro), na Malásia.

O Ministério de Inteligência e Segurança do Irã passou então a investigar aquela instituição e rapidamente descobriu que mantinha contato direto com a CIA. A partir daí, a investigação ganhou fôlego e, em pouco tempo, mais de trinta suspeitos de atividades de espionagem foram identificados e localizados.

Já se sabe que 75% dos acusados de espionagem esse ano têm altas qualificações acadêmicas. Por um lado, pode sugerir novidade na abordagem pela CIA, que agora andaria à caça de cientistas iranianos e estudantes mais bem dotados, pensando em recolher informações a serem utilizadas em curto e médio prazos.

Mas, por outro lado, o fato de estarem sendo abordados estudantes ‘em geral’ (não agentes ou funcionários do governo que têm acesso a informação de melhor qualidade), indicam, também, que a CIA está sem rumo, pressionada pelo tempo e pelo desespero; indica que a Agência não está em condições de selecionar melhor nem a informação que mais lhe interesse nem o melhor informante a recrutar, e tem de operar com recrutas ‘de baixo nível’, na esperança de poder ‘aquecer’ rapidamente esses agentes ‘frios’, uma vez que esses estudantes e cientistas só muito raramente têm acesso a qualquer tipo de informação realmente classificada – além de serem alvos sempre expostos às investigações dos serviços da inteligência iraniana.

Não há dúvidas de que, depois desse mais recente sucesso da inteligência do Irã, as próprias organizações iranianas (entre as quais os serviços de inteligência do Corpo de Guardas da Revolução Islâmica, mas, igualmente, todo o establishment iraniano de defesa) estão em melhores condições para operar, livres de inúmeros espiões dos EUA e, em todos os casos, mais seguros do que antes.

Além do mais, pode-se dizer que, quanto mais a CIA vê-se obrigada a baixar os critérios de exigência e a ter de recrutar agentes ‘frios’, a própria CIA passa a expor-se a riscos maiores, no longo prazo, e mais difícil vai-se tornando a operação dentro do Irã, uma vez que já está bem provado que o Ministério de Inteligência e Segurança do Irã é, sim, perfeitamente capaz de desmontar as redes norte-americanas de espionagem e, como se viu, bem no início daquelas operações.

Em resumo, parece haver hoje certa disparidade entre as tentativas de escalada, nos movimentos de espionagem da CIA no Irã, e a eficácia das respostas de contraespionagem que saem do Ministério de Inteligência e Segurança do Irã. Não parece haver qualquer dúvida de que, hoje, os espiões iranianos estão vencendo essa disputa.

Contudo, apesar de haver progressos muito visíveis nas capacidades de contraespionagem no Irã, o país ainda não alcançou o ponto em que as atividades de espionagem dentro do país tornem-se proibitivas custosas, a ponto de agências ocidentais não conseguirem operar lá. De fato, hoje, todos os serviços secretos dos principais países ocidentais, do Leste Europeu, dos EUA e de Israel ainda operam, on diretamente dentro do Irã, ou fora, associados a elementos da diáspora iraniana.

Seja como for, há claros sinais no ar de que, em termos exclusivamente de guerra de inteligência (que nada tem a ver com ações de sabotagem e ‘assassinatos pré-definidos’ [targeted assassinations]), o Irã já começou a virar o jogo.]]></content:encoded>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17320" title="cia-zion" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cia-zion1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="282" />
<em>The recent success is reinforced by the unraveling of a CIA spy ring in Lebanon operating within the Hezbollah organization.</em>

<strong>By Mahan Abedin</strong>

Iran's claim last week to have arrested 12 spies working for the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is potentially a major blow to American intelligence-gathering efforts in Iran and to American intelligence generally. The arrests come on the heels of the arrest of 30 alleged CIA spies in late May and are indicative of steadily improving counter-intelligence capabilities.

The recent success is reinforced by the unraveling of a CIA spy ring in Lebanon operating within the Hezbollah organization. These reports have been grudgingly confirmed by current and former US intelligence officials, which is suggestive of a major American intelligence defeat, if not a full-blown disaster.

Recent Hezbollah counter-intelligence successes against Israel and the US (in June, Hezbollah arrested two CIA spies operating inside the organization) are at least in part due to increased counter-intelligence assistance from Iran.

Asia Times Online sources in Tehran claim that Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) has been more willing in recent years to transfer sensitive counter-espionage know-how and techniques to both Hezbollah and the official Lebanese intelligence services.

Regarding the arrest of 12 alleged CIA spies by Iran, aside from the clear indication of escalating American intelligence operations, there are two outstanding observations. First, the CIA is operating a lower threshold of quality control in terms of agent recruitment and management. Second, there are signs that the MOIS is moving steadily in the direction of making Iran a forbidding space for hostile foreign intelligence services.

Information from a wide range of Iranian media - and corroborated by ATol sources in Tehran - is suggestive of a scatter-gun approach by the CIA inasmuch as the agency is targeting virtually any Iranian citizen it believes could potentially provide useful information on the CIA's target set.

While there were media reports that some government "managers" were amongst the suspected CIA spies arrested in May, this time around Iran's intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, told local journalists on Sunday that there were no government officials amongst the 12 suspected spies.

Speaking on the fringes of the government's weekly cabinet meeting, Moslehi gave strong indications that most, if not all, of the latest arrested suspected spies were either junior Iranian scientists or students who frequently travelled overseas as part of their studies or official scientific work.

Information gleaned from a wide range of Iranian media over the past six months - and confirmed by ATol sources in Tehran - appears to indicate that besides the high-value targets such as the nuclear program and the country's defense establishment, the CIA's target set includes Iran's banking and financial sector; logistics and transportation networks (particularly air transportation); town planning; the oil and gas sector; and the software industry, particularly private companies that design and operate specialist software for the Iranian government.

More specifically, the CIA appears to be focussed on how Iran is defeating international and unilateral US and European sanctions; how and to what extent Iran is using the international financial system to advance its critical projects as well as its ordinary day-to-day business; the vulnerabilities of Iran's transportation and logistics network; the level of preparedness by Iranian emergency and humanitarian relief organizations; and more generally the resilience of critical Iranian infrastructure in the face of a major disaster or a prolonged period of national stress, such as a military conflict.

To achieve its objectives, the CIA's National Clandestine Service (NCS) has set up a dedicated team of operatives and analysts who operate primarily from countries bordering Iran, but also further afield, particularly in countries with sizeable numbers of Iranian students, such as Malaysia.

This dedicated network is exceptionally well-trained, for example all the operatives and analysts possess a masterful command of the Persian language and display high levels of inter-cultural competence.

Early indications appear to suggest that the CIA started to develop this dedicated network in 2003 and that most of the elements were in place by the middle of 2008. This makes the MOIS' recent counter-intelligence success an even more remarkable achievement, in so far as Iranian counter-intelligence may have doomed the CIA's vast investment almost from the outset.

In the course of its investigations and specialized counter-espionage work, the MOIS claims to have identified 42 officers of the CIA's NCS operating in several countries and collected detailed information on the scope and nature of their activities.

The dedicated NCS team appears to be embedded within numerous official and unofficial American organizations, including US embassies, multinational corporations, medium-sized commercial organizations, recruitment consultancies, immigration and wider legal services, academic and quasi-academic institutions and reputable (ie longstanding) as well as newly set up thinktanks.

If accounts on online Iranian media are to be believed the focus on Iranian scientists and students may have been this dedicated team's downfall. It has been suggested that the 30-person network(s) unraveled earlier this year (and announced in late May) was initially brought to the attention of the MOIS by a patriotic Iranian student who had been approached by a quasi-academic institution (offering grants and scholarships as a means of entrapment) in Malaysia.

The MOIS subsequently investigated the Malaysia-based institution and was able to establish a clear CIA link, which in turn widened the scope of the investigation and eventually netted 30 suspected spies.

It has been reported that 75% of the suspected spies detained this year had higher education qualifications. At one level, this is suggestive of an innovative CIA approach to entrap and recruit gifted Iranian scientists and students with a view to collecting information on the target set in a short to medium time frame.

However, the relative dearth of government officials - or in fact anyone with access to classified or sensitive information - indicates a degree of CIA desperation and an acceptance by the agency that it has to make do with lower quality recruits and manage them to a shorter life span, in view of the agents' lack of ready access to classified materials and the expectation that the MOIS would catch up with them sooner rather than later.

It is also an indication that the most sensitive Iranian organizations (or at least the higher reaches of these organizations) including the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the wider defense establishment, are now either free of American spies or at least more secure than before in the face of determined American espionage efforts.

Furthermore, it can be argued that as the CIA widens and intensifies its agent recruitment efforts it runs the long-term risk of making it more and more difficult to operate inside Iran, in view of the MOIS' proven prowess at penetrating American intelligence networks and learning the key secrets at the heart of these conspiracies at a relatively early stage.

In summary, there appears to be a disparity between escalating CIA espionage and the MOIS' growing counter-espionage resilience, with the latter steadily gaining the upper hand.

But despite clear improvements in counter-espionage capabilities and protective security measures, Iran is still some way away from making it prohibitively costly for Western agencies to operate inside the country. Indeed, all the major West European, North American and Israeli intelligence services are either active inside Iran or work closely with some elements of the Iranian diaspora.

Nevertheless, there are clear signs that in the pure intelligence war (as opposed to sabotage) Iran is beginning to turn the tide.

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17331" title="iemen" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iemen.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332" /><br />
<em>A ausência de informação sobre o Iêmen é gritante.</em></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://www.rebelion.org/" target="_blank">Rebelión</a></em></strong> - [Mónica G. Prieto, Periodismo Humano, Tradução de <em>Diário Liberdade</em>] Beirut. O máximo que a comunidade internacional dedicou de atenção para a revolução social que mobiliza centenas de milhares no Iêmen desde janeiro foram dois minutos. Cento e vinte segundos desperdiçados pelo Conselho de Segurança no dia 21 de outubro para debater como reagir perante a repressão armada de uma população que se colocou massivamente nas ruas para acabar com 33 anos de ditadura, a ameaça de que o conflito armado entre o regime e as tropas desertoras degenere em outra guerra civil, e a crise humanitária – admitida pelas próprias Nações Unidas – que atinge o país e se agrava dia a dia.</p>
<p>“Somente dois minutos. E sabe o que faziam as tropas do presidente Saleh nestes precisos dois minutos? Disparavam contra os manifestantes”, explica recostado em uma poltrona de um café central de Beirute, Farea al Muslimi, um dos mais destacados ativistas iemenitas e um dos mais ativos nos meios de comunicação com o objetivo de gerar certa consciência social no exterior.</p>
<p>Farea não se surpreendeu que o Conselho de Segurança despachasse o dossiê iemenita com mais prontidão do que se solicita a janta em um restaurante. No diário das sessões, a resolução 2014 sequer é identificada com o nome do país, simplesmente se refere a ela como “Resolução sobre Oriente Próximo”. Mais indignante ainda é seu conteúdo, mil mortos e 19.000 feridos depois do início das manifestações sociais: “Em Human Rights Watch nos sentimos decepcionados por um texto que é contraditório”, explica com certo assombro em sua voz Christophe Wilcke, pesquisador de HRW para o Iêmen, contatado por telefone. “Por um lado pede que todos os atores respondam pelos seus crimes, e nós opinamos que isso inclui a Ali Abdullah Saleh, por outro lado respalda a iniciativa do Conselho de Cooperação do Golfo [que media o conflito entre o regime e sua população sem nenhum êxito] que outorga imunidade a Saleh”.</p>
<p>Ou, o que significa a mesma coisa, o Conselho de Segurança presenteou Saleh com uma licença internacional para matar. Enquanto se votava a primeira resolução sobre a atual crise no Iêmen, os disparos soavam pela capital, Sana, para desespero dos cidadãos. Horas depois, o balanço em sangue aumentava, segundo a imprensa local, para 20 mortos no contexto da guerra interna que mantém Saleh com o general desertor Ali Mohsen, seu primo-irmão, seu antigo aliado e agora seu principal inimigo, que mostra a cara ao ditador no comando da I Divisão do Exército e, em teoria, ao lado dos manifestantes.</p>
<p>“Há uma semana que os disparos e os bombardeios são quase diários”, explica por telefone desde Sana Atiaf al Wazir, responsável pelo blog Women from Iemen e outro dos rostos públicos da revolução. “As tropas do regime atacam os desertores, fortes em Hasaba e Sofan [feudos do poderoso líder tribal Ahmed Ahbar, que também abandonou o ditador] e tememos um aumento de seu enfrentamento. Mas isso não tem nada a ver com o acampamento pacífico que levamos a cabo desde fevereiro”, continua mediante a linha telefônica. “Saleh conseguiu que os meios de comunicação coloquem o foco nos combates, mas eles são um detalhe muito pequeno se comparado com a revolução”, insiste Farea, 21 anos e estudante de Ciências Políticas.</p>
<p>Revolução? Que revolução? A ausência de informação sobre o Iêmen é gritante. Desde janeiro, suas marchas são multitudinárias. Rios de homens e mulheres revestem ruas inteiras proferindo gritos de mudança, liberdade e dignidade. Sua luta é a mesma que qualquer outra nação árabe submetida à ditadura, e seus mortos também caem abatidos por balas dos soldados que deveriam defendê-los: “No Iêmen, investem-se milhões de dólares em um Exército que nunca nos defendeu de uma agressão externa”, resume abatido Faria. O país árabe mais pobre, mais instável, o segundo lugar do mundo com mais armas por cabeça – 15 milhões, 61 por cada 100 habitantes – depois dos Estados Unidos e um dos mais instrumentalizados por potências estrangeiras, desde os EUA até a Arábia Saudita, passando pela Al Qaeda, carece de atenção internacional. E cada minuto de silêncio trai a um povo que desafiou o medo e a impunidade para empreender uma revolução pacífica que desemboque em uma democracia.</p>
<p>Em janeiro e fevereiro, as primeiras marchas de dezenas de milhares de pessoas se transformaram em um acampamento permanente junto a Universidade, a qual foi batizada de Praça da Mudança. Jovens e crianças, homens e mulheres, urbanos e membros de tribos que meses atrás nunca se relacionaram com o resto, instalaram-se sem uma única arma para exigir a saída de Saleh, que pretendia entregar em herança a Presidência ao seu filho, perpetuando assim um sistema militar, corrupto e ditatorial baseado no medo. Configurava-se assim um milagre: “No ano passado toda essa gente não teria se conhecido pessoalmente, salvo que estivessem empunhando armas. Pela primeira vez nas últimas décadas, nós iemenitas nos unimos. Saleh nos fez pensar durante anos que éramos serpentes, dizia que governar Iêmen era como dançar sobre cabeças de serpentes, mas esta revolução nos serviu para olharmos uns aos outros. E descobrimos que não somos maus nem temíveis, mas que somos pessoas e que podemos conviver juntos”.</p>
<p>Farea al Muslimi se emociona recordando uma cena na Praça da Mudança de Sana que presenciou há um mês, antes de abandonar Iêmen para retomar seus estudos em Beirute: “Apareceu um jovem de bermuda e com uma toca, o típico rapaz Facebook, e se sentou para conversar com um homem mais velho, membro de uma tribo, adornado com a roupa típica. E começaram a discutir sobre a conveniência de se usar véu. O rapaz lhe dizia que isso não figurava no Corão, o outro argumentava que era o islamicamente correto. É uma conversa impensável há algum tempo atrás. Esta revolução rompeu com a lacuna geracional e algo mais. Antes, somente nos olhávamos cara a cara para combatermos, agora o fazemos para construir algo pacificamente”. O certo é que para os iemenitas sobram-lhes motivos para promover uma revolução, como detalha o jovem universitário: “50% do país é pobre, uma quinta parte da população morre por falta de alimentos, sete milhões vão para a cama com fome, nos meus 21 anos de vida vivi sete guerras, nunca tivemos paz, nem igualdade, nem liberdade... Ou existimos ou não existimos. Ou saímos à rua ou aceitamos morrer em silêncio. Podemos morrer de fome ou morrer nas ruas pela nossa dignidade e a dos nossos”.</p>
<p>E optaram pela última opção. Saleh começou então um jogo de promessas não cumpridas que somente lhe serviam para ganhar tempo e obter silêncio internacional. Primeiro, prometia reformas, depois, que não entregaria o poder ao seu filho, mais tarde, não voltaria a optar pelo poder, finalmente, abandonaria seu cargo quando recebesse garantias que nunca lhe pareciam suficientes. E enquanto isso, ordenava a suas tropas atacar com fogo real e gás lacrimogêneo os manifestantes desarmados, que já ocupavam as principais praças e ruas de todo Iêmen, desde Taiz até Aden, de Sana a Mukalla. Uma insuportável enxurrada de mortes que quase alcançam já o milhar. Mesquitas convertidas em hospitais de campanha, bairros evacuados por seus habitantes por temor aos disparos. E o efeito contrário ao desejado. Como ocorreu com o resto das ditaduras, cada morte civil arrastava mais gente para as ruas. As dezenas se converteram em centenas e aos líderes iniciais somaram-se responsáveis religiosos como Sheikh Abdul-Majid Al-Zindani até milhares como o citado Ali Mohsen, desde muitas tribos do país até os independentes do sul ou os houthis, os rebeldes zaidis que combatem no norte contra a discriminação de sua comunidade. Para assombro de muitos jovens que pretendem mudar o sistema que todos eles representam: “Mas a revolução não é um jardim privado. Qualquer um que aceite seus princípios pode participar”, destaca Farea.</p>
<p>Alguns se preocuparam quando viram passear entre suas fileiras o familiar rosto do general Ali Mohsen, conhecido por seus desmandes ao lado da família Saleh: “É certo que sua presença nos dividiu”, confessa Atiaf, uma das ativistas que participou na redação dos princípios da revolução. “Não saímos às ruas para substituir Saleh por Ali Mohsen. Queremos um Estado de Direito, um Governo que nos represente, um Estado civil baseado na democracia”, incide Farea. “Ali Mohsen não representa nenhuma mudança, foi um sanguinário e corrupto amigo de Saleh, o mesmo que [o líder tribal mais influente do país] Ahmar”, insiste Atiaf al Wazir. “Mas não podemos impedir que se somem à revolução”. Tampouco se pode impedir que tomem as armas para defender aos manifestantes dos disparos do regime, convertendo Sana em uma cidade militarizada e começando os combates que hoje em dia paralisam a cidade: “Há checkpoints por todos os lugares, alguns amigos contaram quantos há do centro ao aeroporto: somam 16. Alguns são dos desertores, outros de Saleh”, detalha Fatima Saleh, outra ativa tuiteira iemenita envolvida na revolução social.</p>
<p>Como demonstra a ambígua resolução 2014, as vidas humanas valem barato no Iêmen. Décadas de guerras e a mais recente aparição da Al Qaeda estigmatizaram o país mais pobre do mundo árabe, sem recursos energéticos que inquietem os dirigentes ocidentais: “Iêmen não tem importância para a comunidade internacional. Carece de petróleo e não tem Israel em suas fronteiras, assim não afeta os interesses regionais”, avalia Hakim al Masmari, direto do diário Iêmen Post, em conversa telefônica desde Sana. “Saleh é como qualquer outro ditador: sente-se forte porque não se sente questionado, mas em qualquer momento pode descobrir sua debilidade. Continuará com sua agenda porque pensa que ninguém pode lhe tirar do poder”. Tanto Al Masmari como Wilcke, assim como Ataif al Wazir e outros ativistas, respondem de forma automática o que poderia se fazer para parar o ditador. Sanções econômicas, proibição de viajar para ele e os seus – das forças a cargo de seu filho e seus sobrinhos depende seu poder militar –, congelamento de bens no estrangeiro, asfixia econômica... “A revolução iemenita foi abandonada diferentemente de outras revoluções principalmente pelos EUA e Arábia Saudita”, explica ao Periodismo Humano mediante correio eletrônico Noon Arabia, pseudônimo da autora do blog Notas de Noon e uma das tuiteiras mais ativas e influentes em relação com o Iêmen. “Saleh foi complacente com a política saudita no Iêmen, foi um servidor leal e também um aliado americano na chamada guerra contra o terror, permitindo-lhes atacar com drones [aviões não tripulados] o território iemenita quando o desejem, em troca de receber ajudas militares. Ambos os países desejam manter o status quo pese a sua retórica sobre a necessidade de que abandone o poder. E dado que os meios de comunicação principais são financiados por esses países, faz-se vista grossa sobre o que passa no Iêmen”.</p>
<p>Para os grandes meios de comunicação, Iêmen é Al Qaeda. Para os iemenitas, Al Qaeda é uma mera anedota em uma vida de sofrimentos. Mas desde que Saleh vendeu o espaço aéreo para Washington em troca de ajuda militar, essa anedota custa vidas e condena famílias inteiras. O assassinato de Abdul Rahman al Awlaqi foi um ponto de inflexão. No fim de setembro os EUA se parabenizava publicamente por assassinar o seu pai, Anwar al Awlaqi, cidadão americano-iemenita e um dos comandantes locais da Al Qaeda, mediante um bombardeio aéreo. Em 14 de outubro, a população se comovia após saber da morte de seu filho, Abdul Rahman, de 16 anos, um adolescente fã de livros de Harry Poter e da série Crepúsculo, em outro ataque aéreo. Sua família sustenta que foi bombardeado enquanto participava de um churrasco com seus amigos: “Era um rapaz que ia à escola e que não podia ser mais distante da luta de seu pai. Seu único delito foi estar junto a ele. Se falam tanto de promover a democracia, o mínimo que deveriam fazer seria prendê-los e levá-los a julgamento, ao invés de executá-los”, disse Atiaf com raiva.</p>
<p>Al Qaeda é um espantalho que emprega Saleh para conservar suas alianças. Sobretudo, desde que o grupo terrorista tentou assassinar um dos príncipes mais influentes da Arábia Saudita, o ultraconservador Nayef, ministro do Interior, e muito provavelmente o novo herdeiro do trono wahabi, após a recente morte do príncipe Sultan por um suicida forrado de explosivos em agosto de 2009. Iêmen desempenha um papel central nas ações da Al Qaeda desde sua fundação, mas ganhou peso nos últimos anos estendendo suas ambições até os Estados Unidos, onde organizou alguns atentados com escasso êxito. Sua força radica, pelo julgamento dos ativistas iemenitas, na estratégia clandestina do regime de Saleh.</p>
<p>“O regime engana o Ocidente dizendo-lhe que se mantendo no poder reduzirá a influência da Al Qaeda, mas meu acompanhamento das notícias de Iêmen me faz pensar que o regime distribuiu armas para alguns grupos divididos das forças de Segurança para intimidar o Ocidente. É uma mensagem que diz “olha o que pode acontecer se o regime cai”, aponta Fatima Saleh. É um temor difundido na sociedade iemenita: “Durante anos Saleh jogou com o extremismo”, menciona Atiaf. “Ele os usa, prende, liberta, deixa escapar, serve-se deles para conseguir seus objetivos políticos”. E enquanto isso, a população sofre com os bombardeios americanos com os quais Washington tira sarro da legalidade internacional que exige dos demais: “Em Abiyan os bombardeios deixaram 90 mil desabrigados”, lamenta Atiaf. “Foram instalados em escolas, mas isso deixou sem colégio a todas as crianças da região. Tudo isso cria um enorme ressentimento em relação aos Estados Unidos”. No total, as diferentes formas de violência resultaram em uns 300 mil desabrigados em todo o país, que vivem em condições subumanas.</p>
<p>Farea, fiel aos seus estudos universitários, explica a presença da Al Qaeda no Iêmen – onde tem sua base na Península Arabiga, o AQAP, uma das principais plataformas da organização de Bin Laden em todo o mundo – como resultado da política da ditadura: “O Governo não nos defende da Al Qaeda. Não existe um contrato social em meu país, por isso prosperam organizações fanáticas como essa. A desigual distribuição de recursos afeta inclusive as pessoas mais preparadas, ninguém tem esperanças porque a corrupção impede de conseguir um trabalho, salvo que se tenha dinheiro ou influências. Para muita gente, a Al Qaeda é a única opção. Te oferecem um salário e um paraíso, quem dá mais? Saleh alimenta a Al Qaeda com seu regime corrupto. E não vai ser tão estúpido ao ponto de acabar com eles porque perderia milhões tratando-se de cooperação militar”. Daí que o povo, segundo este jovem ativista, veja com os mesmos olhos a ditadura, a Al Qaeda e os Estados Unido: “Perdemos o respeito a eles. Eles não se preocupam pelas vidas humanas, prejudicam nossa economia, não nos representam. As pessoas estão fartas”.</p>
<p>Sem uma firme reação internacional, que possibilidades têm os jovens iemenitas que insistem em perpetuar seu protesto pacífico? “A diferença com a Tunísia e o Egito é que lá o Exército está fundado sobre uma base nacional; no Iêmen ele está sobre uma base familiar”, lamenta Al Muslimi. Refere-se à Guarda Republicana e às divisões comandadas por familiares de Saleh, as melhores e mais equipadas do país. “Deve-se parar os militares, mas é impossível enquanto lhes siga chegando dinheiro em questão de ajuda militar”, complementa Ataif em alusão às doações americanas em troca de que Saleh combata – oficialmente – a Al Qaeda. Agora é questão de paciência, argumentam os entrevistados, e de evitar a tentação de tomar as armas: “A revolução não é uma corrida. Os antecedentes colocaram o bastão muito alto, mas não temos pressa para que a revolução triunfe. Esperamos 33 anos e podemos seguir esperando; do contrário, levaremos nosso país ao inferno”, acrescenta Farea em uma sucinta alusão a uma revolução armada. “Sabemos que isto não terminará quando Saleh tenha saído do poder. Tratará de deixar seu filho e seus sobrinhos e teremos de seguir lutando pacificamente. Serão anos de luta, mas se aguardamos 33 anos de ditadura podemos fazê-lo”, acrescenta Atiaf.</p>

<p>Surpreende a quantidade de mulheres ativistas que trabalham na revolução iemenita. Nas manifestações, milhares de feministas vestidas com niqab gritam palavras de ordem separadas dos homens, segundo corresponde em uma sociedade muito tradicional, mas não duvidam ao tomar ações drásticas e provocadoras como queimar véus para chamar a atenção dos meios de comunicação. Atiaf, Fatima ou Noon Arabiya não são casos isolados, como demonstra o fato de que a principal ativista do país, Tawakol Karman, presidenta da ONG Mulheres Jornalistas Sem Correntes, tenha sido reconhecida com o Prêmio Nobel da Paz junto a outras duas mulheres. Explicam-me desde Iêmen entre risadas: “Quinze milhões de mulheres iemenitas levamos a revolução há anos”. Ou séculos: “Lembre-se da rainha de Saba”, disse Farea com um sorriso aberto. Ela reinou antes que chegasse o Islamismo ao Iêmen; anos depois, outra mulher subiria ao trono do país islamizado, Arwa Bin Ahmad al Sulaihi: governaria 55 anos. Para elas e eles, o temor mais difundido é que Saleh aprenda a lição equivocada do exemplo líbio e opte por combater até a morte para conservar o poder: “Muitos estão esperando uma guerra, ou ao menos enfrentamentos muito duradouros entre a I Divisão e a Guarda Republicana em Sana e os milicianos pró-revolucionários e a Guarda Republicana em Taiz”, explica Fatima mediante e-mail enviado desde Sana. “Saleh tem muita má intenção, está tentando empurrar a guerra para as pessoas envolvidas na revolução pacífica usando qualquer meio ao seu alcance para provocá-las”, prossegue a ativista.</p>
<p>No entanto, Al Masmari descarta um conflito em grande escala: “Trata-se de uma guerra pessoal entre Ali Mohsen e Saleh e aí vai ficar. Os iemenitas não vão combater, as marchas seguirão sendo pacíficas”, estima o diretor do Iêmen Post. Atiaf al Wazir teme que as coisas mudem rápido: “Durante nove meses a revolução foi pacífica, mas as pessoas pacíficas estão sendo atacadas com armas. Se o enfrentamento militar se estende, é imprevisível o que pode acontecer porque ambas as partes têm grandes arsenais”. No entanto, descarta que os movimentos já armados, como os separatistas do sul ou os houthis, envolvam-se em uma guerra: “Não creio que se envolvam porque não tirariam benefícios, mas é certo que ambos os lados, tanto as tropas de Ali Mohsen como as de Saleh, têm muitíssimas armas após anos de guerra e anos de compras de recursos bélicos. A demonstração de força pode converter-se em um enfrentamento aberto”.</p>
<p>Parece claro que a juventude iemenita está farta de violência: “Crescemos rodeados de armas, já não queremos mais balas”, repudia Farea com um gesto casual. “Esta revolução é pacífica ou não é. Mas não sei o que vai ocorrer quando se acabe a paciência dos iemenitas. Se se decepcionam podem se converter em um vulcão. Eles têm potencial e ganharam a mudança após nove meses manifestando-se em paz. Imagine todo esse potencial com armas”. Farea mexe na barba antes de prosseguir: “Eu prefiro não pensar nisso: não sou valente o bastante para imaginar como seria Iêmen se se opta pela via armada”.</p>
<p>Após dez meses de revolução social e mil mortos, uma fraca resolução do Conselho de Segurança concede imunidade ao ditador Ali Abdullah Saleh, responsável da repressão militar contra civis. Praticamente a totalidade da sociedade iemenita se uniu contra o tirano em uma estranha irmandade, pouco comum no país árabe.</p>

<em>Dependency on the Western-controlled and manipulated currency market is the only reason why economic sanctions are effective; MGE19's Economic Structural Models will help a nation to regain its economic sovereignty and independence.</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/mge19/" target="_blank">Deitric Muhammad</a></strong>

<em>In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful</em>

<em>In this report I desire to demonstrate how the so-called Financial Crisis was actually created, and how the so-called Quantitative Easing experiment coupled with increased regulations imposed on the financial sector and the consolidation of the global banking sectors are designed to collapse the world economies in order to “justify” implementing a global economic system that can be overtly controlled by these global banking elites. Secondly, I would like to demonstrate that all of these economic calamities are just smoke and mirrors that are only propped up through war and debt. The solution to the world's economic problems can be easily solved without the input, assistance, or help of the Western nations, international banks, or multinational companies—whether from the West, the East, or any external economic power. I am not saying this from a posture of arrogance or vanity. It is what it is. Each nation can develop its economy independently while being dependent solely on its own domestic economy. However, if the desire is to become a supranational economic bloc such as the AU or ALBA, this can be achieved also. However, in my opinion, it would be better for each nation to learn how to develop its own economy first. This would enable a much easier, quicker, and seamless economic integration due to a complete and clear understanding of how economics actually works. Nevertheless, these countries can develop their economies by connecting their economies to the land and disconnect it from the Western-controlled money markets. For money has NO VALUE in and of itself.</em>

The so-called World Financial Crisis is reported to have began in 2008 with US housing values falling and foreclosure rates increasing. This in turn caused the global markets to go haywire because debts were not being paid, and this caused the banks to withhold credit issuance because now the world was in a credit crisis dubbed “The Credit Crunch”. Therefore banks who had distributed “sub-prime rate” loans were not able to receive payment from these “risky” loans and became insufficient in liquidity in order to maintain operations. This is why so many smaller banks failed. However, the bigger banks were also lacking in liquidity and needed to be “bailed-out” by the government because unlike their smaller counterparts, they were “too big to fail”. Although this began as an American problem, it somehow affected the entire global economy, and other countries were affected. The alleged cause is that unscrupulous bankers gave loans to people to buy homes that they knew they could not afford. In other words, bad bankers gave bad loans to poor people to buy homes they could not afford, and this triggered a global reaction that brought down the likes of Lehman Brothers, AIG, and Circuit City with J.P. Morgan, Chase, and Bank of America “struggling to survive” but needed help from the US government because they were “too big to fail”??? Does this make any sense to anyone? If it does, then how could an exclusively American problem that began with the American housing market affect the world markets the way they did?

Actually, my company predicted the so-called Financial Crisis as early as October 2005, and gave the details of what was happening, how it was going to occur, and what were the direct causes for the so-called Financial Crisis in our Proven Insights on Market Predictability <a href="http://www.mge19.com/Econreport2006.pdf" target="_blank">Economic Report FY2006</a>.

(See <a href="http://www.slide.com/r/SJkV4Vob3D_kaCYWwq9Qp03Rx13kZx2R?previous_view=TICKER&amp;previous_action=TICKER_ITEM_CLICK&amp;ciid=72057594196656463" target="_blank">here</a> for proof of early market movement detection).

In the report under “Strategic Investments” concerning real estate, I specifically stated:

<em>As we are now aware, prices are falling and the real estate sector is not immune. To those who benefited from the housing boom, this market will look unattractive during Q1-Q4. However, those who are patient and expect the boom to occur again, or those who desire to acquire land for agribusiness, investment property, etc. will benefit from this time. Prices will fall, and so will “property value”. This is a golden opportunity to acquire real estate, or land, for future investments.</em>

Prices were already falling, but at a slow pace due to rising interest rates (<em>Read the first two paragraphs of the report</em>). Secondly, if anyone is curious how the bigger companies and banks were able to survive, the so-called Credit Crunch, just remember what was written under the Real Estate section of the report in the last sentence:

<em>The best position to be in is to have major capital saved for this time to take advantage of this future period of low prices.</em>

The banks and companies that survived the so-called Credit Crunch had sufficient amounts of liquidity (cash) that enabled them to survive the crisis, and those that received the “bailout money” were enabled to buy up the assets of other companies and banks leading up to the precipitated consolidation of companies and the banking and financial sectors. Lack of liquidity is the excuse used to close banks that did survive the crisis through the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/bcreg20090424a1.pdf" target="_blank">Supervisory Capitalization Assessment Program (SCAP)</a> or the stress tests.

MGE19 accurately <a href="http://www.mge19.com/FC1.pdf" target="_blank">predicted</a> how the TARP money would be used by the banks before they received it. The question that eludes many is what caused the Financial Crisis in the first place? The answer is that these criminals not only broke US and international laws, but they deliberately broke a very important natural law that applies to all debt issuances and bonds: <em>The inverse law of value and interests</em>.

The law is simply this:

<em>If the “value” of a bond increases, then the interest rate decreases;</em>

<em>if the “value” of a bond decreases, then the interest rate increases.</em>

This creates a natural balance that allows the interest rate of a debt to adjust in order to compensate for the “value fluctuation” of a debt. Is this clear? Ok.

Since today's currencies are neither backed by a “monetized” commodity nor governed by a monetary standard, what constitutes the “value” of a currency? It will have to be the “purchasing power” of the currency. If the purchasing power of a currency “increases”, this is denoted by a <em>decrease in prices. This is because it takes less currency to purchase a product than before. Hence, the currency has <em>increased in value</em>.</em>

(Ex. Today: TV= R 200.00 Tomorrow: Same TV=R 100.00)

If the the purchasing power of a currency “decreases”, this is denoted by an <em>increase in prices</em>. This because it takes <em>more</em> currency to purchase a product than before. Hence, the currency has <em>decreased in value</em>.

(Ex. Today: TV= R 200.00 Tomorrow: Same TV=R 300.00)

When a bank gives out a loan, they first recognize the value of the currency and adjust their interest rates accordingly. If the value of the currency increases, they will lower the interest rate in order to compensate for the increased value. They understand that the currency they will receive back in payments will be stronger and the profit made from the interest will balance out at the smaller rate. If the value of a currency decreases, they will raise the interest rate in order to compensate for the decreased value. They understand that the currency they will receive back in payments will not be able to purchase as much as it did before, and <em>they must increase the interest rate in order to protect themselves from profit loss and a negative financial position</em>.

Of course, this is under the assumption that this is under a “free market economy” where the markets are allowed to <em>freely determine</em> such factors as interest rates, prices, and value based on supply and demand and <em>free market forces</em>. The truth is market forces have <em>never</em> been free. Market forces have been, are, and always will be <em>deliberate, directed, and controlled</em>.

To all the Keynesian and monetarist economic students, professors, and theorists:

I am sorry, but you have been lied to, deceived, miseducated, and mistrained. Market forces are also known as money-supply forces. Those who control the money-supply, control the forces. With this in mind, why would the American central bank decrease the supply of US dollars by selling USD $30 billion worth of Treasury bonds and simultaneously increase interest rates as high as 5.25%?

Before I go further into this, I am compelled to break this down further:

The difference between a Treasury bond and Treasury note are their maturity. A Treasury note has a maturity of 3 months to 1 year. If Treasury notes are sold, then dollars will only be out of circulation for 3 months up to a year, which does not make much of an impact on the economy because it would be as if dollars were never gone and would not be missed. However, a Treasury bond has a maturity up to 30 years. This will have a great impact on the economy. If Treasury bonds are sold, the economy will <em>feel</em> the impact of dollars being taken out the economy due to possibly being out of circulation for such a long period of time. This has a great impact on price. Why? Although supply and demand are pivotal to the value and pricing of products, nothing is more pivotal, more impactful, and more important to an economy than the supply and demand of currency because all products and services in an economy are valued and priced in that currency. Therefore, the <em>supply and demand of a currency</em> in an economy is <em>the largest determining factor in the price and value of a product or service</em>—period.

Since taking dollars out of circulation by selling Treasury bonds increases the value of the US dollar, why then would the American central bank increase the interest rate? Which interest rate is that? It is called the “Fed Fund Rate”. The Fed Fund Rate is the rate in which subordinate banks borrow from the <em>overnight window</em> of the American central bank in order to keep their accounts “liquid” or in cash form, in order to lend to other banks, companies, and individuals. They must base their interest rates on the Fed Fund Rate in which they borrow from the Federal Reserve. So much for the theory of <em>free market forces</em>. The Federal Reserve controls the money-supply by not only <em>printing dollars</em> as many believe, but also by taking out and adding in dollars through <em>the selling and purchasing of long-term bonds</em>.

(*Since we are on this note, I must state something about the so-called stimulus packages and why they did not <em>stimulate</em> the economy as proposed. If a car dealership were to recall 1 million cars, would it have any effect on the car market? Probably not, because those cars are still <em>in the market</em>. They were recalled by a car dealership—one out of many car dealerships that sell the same cars, and it only affects that particular dealership and its customers. However, if a car manufacturer recalled those same 1 million cars, would it have an effect on the car market? Of course it would! Those cars would be considered <em>out of the market</em> because the car manufacturer is the <em>maker of the cars</em> and are the ones responsible for putting them in the market in the first place. Well, the US government does not manufacture, or create, the US dollar. The central bank does. This is why the stimulus packages did not work. It was nothing more than <em>recycled tax dollars that were already in circulation</em>. Therefore, it had no effect. There was <em>no change in the supply of dollars</em> in the economy. )

So again I ask, “Why would the American central bank decrease the supply of US dollars by selling USD $30 billion worth of Treasury bonds and simultaneously increase interest rates as high as 5.25%?”*

(*<em>Actually up to at least $100 billion was taken out of circulaton in total during this deflationary period. We just caught the first instance in September 2005.)</em>

Unless it was a deliberate plot to upset the US banking and financial sectors in order to drastically minimize competition and consolidate the US financial and banking sectors while gaining direct access to taxpayer dollars? This is why TARP was proposed—to give capitalization to banks in order to buy up so-called “toxic assets”, or properties that were losing value, that were on the banks' spreadsheets. However, when they received it, they decided NOT to buy up those assets, and utilize the money for “capitalization purposes”. It appeared as if the US government “owned” these banks, but these banks used the money to invest in buying up smaller banks and/or their assets and returned to the US government what they borrowed. I am not sure if there were any interest attached to the loans. In order to receive the TARP money, the banks had to become “bank holding companies”. This accurately explains <em>the function</em> of such a an organizational structure. They reorganized themselves in order to “hold” the assets of defunct and struggling banks, and received the financing to do so. Brilliant scheme! However, do we understand the impact of how disrespecting and breaking the inverse law of bonds as applied to the US money-supply affected the economy?

To completely understand what occurred, the so-called Financial Crisis must be viewed from three perspectives: the company, the individual, and the bank.

<strong>The Company</strong>

Most companies borrow from banks to keep their businesses solvent and to expand their businesses. With this in mind, due to falling prices, companies were not generating the same level of revenue as they were previously, and they were still obligated to pay back the money they borrowed at a steadily-increasing interest rate. These companies did not want to pay the interest rate, so they added the interest into the price of their goods and services to pass it on to their customers. This appeared to many to be inflation. However, it was the phenomenon of companies adding the interest rate that they must pay to their creditors into the price of their goods and services. This includes the price of oil and food. For many companies, their revenue levels decreased significantly due to falling prices, their equity values were dwindling, and their debt levels were increasing due to rising interest rates. To cut costs, labor levels were decreased. However, this lead to less productivity and the savings that were made from cutting labor costs were not realized due to less revenue and higher debt. Assets were dwindling in value as well. Most companies were losing across the board. They could no longer pay off their debts, and many went into bankruptcy.

<strong>The Individual</strong>

Many had bought homes during the housing boom for personal and investment purposes. Many had made loans from banks to purchase residential and commercial properties. This was assisted with the low but reasonable interest rate at that time. The labor market was healthier at that time than it is currently. However, food prices and oil prices began to rise significantly. Oil prices were increasing due to oil companies adding the interest costs of their loans into the price of their product. This can be readily-seen by observing the correlation between when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and when oil prices spiked. With the rising of oil prices, the increased production of ethanol was being justified. This is when corn is turned into fuel. Corn is a staple ingredient in most food products. When corn--which is normally used for food--is now being used for fuel, the supply of corn significantly decreases. This means that the demand for corn significantly increases. Therefore, the price of corn significantly increases, and subsequently, any food that contains corn, a corn product, or a corn by-product in it significantly increases in price. Many were laid-off during this period and could no longer properly fulfill their financial obligations. Those that maintained their employment experienced financial difficulties due to rising costs. Some had to take a pay-reduction to keep their jobs. Others that kept the same level of pay had difficulty getting to work due to increasing fuel costs. Those that owned homes had to pay off their mortgages with increasing interest rates. In some instances, a decision had to be made between paying a bill or buying food. Food costs were rising, fuel costs were rising, and mortgages and rents were rising, but their income remained the same or was reduced. Many could no longer afford their homes, so they went into foreclosure. They preferred to stay in cheaper homes or apartments than to be weighed down by debt from their mortgages. This explains the high rate of foreclosures. Those that had assets realized that the value of those assets were also decreasing. Some had sold some of their assets to pay down debt. However, for many, the value of those assets had depreciated significantly and was not sufficient in paying off their debts and other financial obligations.

<strong>The Bank</strong>

Due to rising interest rates and falling revenue levels, many companies were no longer able to fulfill their financial obligations to their banking institutions. Many individuals had lost their jobs, or defaulted on their loans due to rising living costs and falling asset values. This resulted in significantly reduced revenue levels for banks. Although banks were able to confiscate assets earmarked for collateral and foreclosed residential and commercial properties, the value of these assets were dwindling at an alarming rate. Equity investments were falling in value as well. This has nothing to do with any “bubble” that reached its point, and then burst. It has everything to do with deflationary pressure that drove prices down--coupled with increasing interest rates. This is why so many banks could no longer stay in business. They could no longer recover losses from loans issued, nor could they recover losses from assets and investments that were depreciating in value. This had nothing to do with the issuance of sub-prime loans to poor people who could not afford to repay those loans by so-called predatory banks. Banks are risk-adverse by nature, and would have never issued loans to individuals that were not able to repay them at the date of issuance. Even if this was so, how could it have such a global impact in the world economies if this began as a problem in the US housing market? Deflation is a money-supply force. Who controls the money supply of the American economy? The Federal Reserve. Who determines the interest rate? The Federal Reserve. The very ones who claim to be solving the problem actually created the problem in the first place.

How did this become a “global” economic event? The answer is: The Bretton Woods Conference of 1944. This is the conference were the world's economies were unified by the direct pegging of currencies to the US dollar. The world's currencies dropped their monetary standards to attach themselves to the gold standard <em>through</em> the US dollar (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mge19.com/Corruption.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).

On 15 August 1971, the US dollar was disconnected from the gold standard, but the world's economies and currencies were never disconnected from the US dollar. In effect, the US dollar and the world currencies are now subjected to the money-supply decisions and interest rate targets of the Federal Reserve. Those money-supply decisions are what <em>determine</em> what money-supply forces are applied. The interest rate targets are what determine <em>the rate</em> in which the effect of those money-supply forces are applied.

On 25 March 2009, the Federal Reserve decided to <em>buy USD $ 100 billion of Treasury bonds</em>—adding USD $100 billion into the economy-- inducing inflationary pressure while simultaneously and deliberately reducing interest rates to near-zero levels. This is known as “quantitative easing” (<em>Note: at least USD $600 billion worth of Treasury bonds have been purchased by 2011</em>). I had warned some Latin American governments and Southern African governments in a letter I wrote on 5 May 2009 about the upcoming inflationary pressure and the effects it will have on their economies, as well as the H1N1 swine flu vaccination scheme <a href="http://www.mge19.com/Aviso.pdf" target="_blank">planned by the World Health Organization</a>. Now this is a reversal of the monetary policy applied from September 2005 to 25 March 2009. The value of the US dollar has diminished, yet interest rates remain low.

<strong><em>Remember the inverse law of bonds: If the value of a bond decreases, then the interest rate increases.</em></strong>

So if the value of the US dollar is decreasing, then why are they forcing interest rates to remain near zero?

The answer to this can be discovered in the effects from the application of this monetary policy on the 3 main players of any economy: the individual laborers, the companies, and the banks.

<strong>The Company</strong>

The reason why companies borrow money from banks is because they prefer to use external sources of capital to invest and expand their businesses as opposed to using their profits and earnings. If a company uses their profits to invest and expand its business, then those profits can no longer be considered <em>profit</em>. It would be considered <em>capital</em>, and the profit levels would actually <em>decrease</em>. The same with using a company's <em>earnings</em>. Those earnings would no longer be considered earnings because they are now used for <em>capitalization purposes</em>, and would have a diminishing effect on earnings. For corporations, the diminishing earnings and profit levels would reflect in their equity holdings such as stock value and price-over-earnings (P/E) ratio. This is why <em>external capitalization</em> is sought after, and why companies borrow from banks—in order to <em>leverage</em> themselves by using the bank's money to expand their businesses and pay the banks back from the revenue generated from the use of that capital. With this in mind, many companies had financial setbacks due to the so-called Credit Crunch/World Financial Crisis. Employment levels were low, productivity was low, revenue levels had decreased, and many companies had trouble paying back their debts. Once inflationary pressure was initiated with the <strong><em>purchase of over USD $100 billion of Treasury bonds</em></strong> by the Federal Reserve, prices began to increase, revenue levels began to improve somewhat, yet employment levels were slow to increase, and so was economic growth. Why? The Federal Reserve decided to introduce <em>quantitative easing</em> which would allow <em>easier or more fluid</em> liquidity to enter the markets in order to<em> increase</em> economic growth. Why does it seem that the <em>economic recovery</em> is taking so long to precipitate—especially <em>after</em> the over USD $1 trillion bank bailouts, stimulus packages, and this QE experiment—sorry, I meant solution? Well, after all of this economic stimulation, the banks simply <em>refuse to give out any loans</em>. Why? Why would a bank give out loans to receive back currency that is diminishing in value with a near-zero interest rate? They would literally make no money, and most likely will go into a <em>negative</em> financial position. Since companies are unable to receive capitalization from banks, they are hard-pressed to receive capitalization from other sources such as venture capitalists, private equity firms, angels, and other sources which may have more stringent criteria and requirements in order to receive capital than simply paying back a loan with interest. Simply put, companies are having a difficult time receiving capital to invest and expand their business and maintain operations. This explains why employment levels have not increased significantly and why economic growth has not increased significantly. The unemployment rate has impacted companies negatively for two reasons:

(1)less productivity

(2)laborers play a dual role as consumers

Less employment levels translate into less consumption levels. This also significantly impact revenue-generation levels for companies. This is why the economic recovery has been so slow and stagnant—threatening to become a secondary recession.

<strong>The Individual Laborer</strong>

The individual laborer has been most ill-affected by the so-called World Financial Crisis due to high fuel and food costs, unemployment, and increased indebtedness due to foreclosures, high interest rates, and the inability to satisfy financial obligations. Many have sought unemployment subsidies to help in their financial troubles. Some have looked for other sources of employment or went into business for themselves. The problem with the latter is financing due to the reluctance of banks and other money lenders to finance businesses and projects in spite of the quantitative easing experiments. The high unemployment rate proved to be a <em>fiscal drain</em> on the nation's budget due to the high level of subsidization and non-productivity. Of course, the fiscal drain caused by unemployment is a pea next to a mountain when compared to the fiscal drain of the military adventures around the globe, but that's besides the point. The individual laborer has suffered a great deal. However, with increased economic activity –albeit slow, employment levels are increasing. This is directly due to inflationary pressure which has increased prices nominally and has induced an increase in revenue-generation levels for companies. Inflationary pressure also increases the costs of goods and services. This includes food, fuel, houses, etc. The positive side is that labor costs will increase which means a person can do the same job for a higher pay rate. However, the demand for labor may be significantly lower than the supply of labor and may have an impact on what a laborer can demand in terms of pay. In other words, a laborer may not have much negotiating power in terms of pay or salary due to the high supply of laborers that are willing to do the same job for less than what is the normal pay grade. If the laborer is employed, the laborer will experience rising costs without rising pay or salary. This will put the laborer in a similar financial position as was during the so-called Financial Crisis.

<strong>The Bank</strong>

Banks have been hard hit by the so-called Financial Crisis also. At least, the smaller ones did. With diminishing revenue streams, fallen equity and real estate investment values, and punitive banking regulations, it is almost unimaginable how any of these banks survived with the little capital that they had left over. The Supervisory Capitalization Assessment Program (SCAP), aka <em>the stress tests</em>, are punishing these smaller banks in the US for surviving with some capital left over. Capitalization is the<em> key factor</em> in determining which banks survived the so-called Credit Crunch and who perished and had their assets picked off by the banking vultures. To be more specific: <em>liquid capital was the determining factor</em>. Remember what I wrote in the Real Estate section of my company's economic report:

<em>The best position to be in is to have major capital saved for this time to take advantage of this future period of low prices.</em>

This demonstrates that those who knew what was coming, prepared for it, and took advantage of less fortunate banks by buying them out or buying up their assets. Those that were able to survive the onslaught are now subject to punitive regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act which require banks to<em> minimize investment risks</em> by capping their investments with hedge funds and investment banks to 3%--which is known as <em>the Volcker Rule</em>. The excuse is that banks made “risky bets” by giving out sub-prime loans during the height of the US housing boom. However, where there is little risk there is little reward which translate into <em>little growth</em>. The nature of banks is to be <em>risk-adverse</em>, and are prone to invest in “sure things”. I am sure you heard the adage that “banks only give money to those who don't need it”. The allegation that banks were taking too many risks, and were directly responsible for their lack of liquidity during the so-called Credit Crunch is groundless. This investment risk cap actually limits their potential growth levels which positions them for low growth and eventual financial collapse or financial ruin. Think about it. These banks can not distribute loans because of the risk of receiving currency that has a much lower purchasing power than before and interest rates are forcibly low so that the banks will not reap any profit nor would they have any cushion to protect themselves from the lower purchasing power of the US dollar if they were to distribute loans. In other words, little if any, revenue stream from loan distribution can be precipitated. During this inflationary period, the banks' real estate and equity investments are doing better because prices are rising. However, costs are catching up with revenue--diminishing profit margins and reducing stock values. Although banks are still able to invest in hedge funds, hedge funds are becoming a thing of the past. (<em>More on this later.)</em> This limits the banks' investment options drastically. In a nutshell, their revenue streams have been significantly reduced due to lack of loan distribution, and their investment choices have been minimized and capped—thanks to Senator Dodd and House Representative Frank. To make matters worse, draconian regulations have been imposed on these banks so that if they have not raised enough cash by time its their turn to take the stress tests—they are forcibly shut down with their assets picked by the vultures. Today is a sad day for smaller banks. However, let's say that they comply to all of these regulations, conform to the Dodd-Frank Act, and survive the stress tests. What will happen to all of the liquid capital that the banks have raised? Considering that we are in an inflationary period, the capital will grow weaker by the day—rendering the banks poorer and positioning them to fall into a negative financial position.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

During a prolonged inflationary period, prices rise but costs eventually catch up with revenue—causing equity values to fall and economic growth to slow down. With interest rates near zero--until 2013 at the earliest or until 2015 at the latest--signals that inflation will last until at least 2013. From 2009 to 2013 will make 4 years—one of the longest inflationary periods in US history. This will pretty much destroy economic growth in the US—bringing about economic collapse. This--with the consolidation of the financial and banking sectors—will establish a gripping command economy in the United States of such magnitude that even Hitler would blush. The US is becoming a “Third World” nation at an accelerated rate—economically-speaking. Just like Mr. de Rothschild of England allegedly stated: “I want to make the United States a colony again.” It looks like he's making his word... BOND. (<em>Get it? He disrespects the inverse law of bonds, but want to make his word... Nevermind.)</em>

<strong>Predictive Analysis</strong>

Studying and analyzing the world's currencies, MGE19 has discovered that it is mainly the United States and Eurozone nations that are implementing this chaotic monetary policy. Other nations have raised their interest rate to a high percentage in order to slow down inflationary pressure (see <a href="http://www.mge19.com/premiumeconreports.htm" target="_blank">here</a>)<em></em>. Due to a <em>loophole</em> in the Dodd-Frank Act, many hedge funds will become “<em>family operations</em>” where the hedge funds will pay out their <em>external investors</em> and only operate their <em>personal stakes</em> in these hedge funds. This will make the hedge fund owners and their relatives exempt from being regulated and subjected to the Dodd-Frank Act. In other words, hedge funds will tell their former investors: “<em>Thanks for helping us to make so much money over the years, but we don't need you any more!”</em> This is why banks who were able to increase their risk levels with hedge funds and investment banks will become very limited in their options to grow their newly-acquired capital. Hedge funds in the United States will become a thing of the past. Smaller banks who are fighting to survive the <em>stress tests</em> will be acquiring liquid capital (cash) that is diminishing in purchasing power. Interest rates are too low to risk distributing loans—which is a source of revenue for banks, and their risk-levels have been drastically reduced—meaning their growth potential has been drastically reduced. Due to rising living costs, the individual laborer will not be able to save as much disposable income as before, significantly reducing deposit volumes for banks. That's less deposit revenue that can be used to make any investments to grow the banks' wealth or improve its financial position. For smaller banks, individual laborers, and many companies, the so-called Financial Crisis had only been extended. Equity values have increased, but soon—if not already—you will see the price of equities fall. Just like oil prices have fallen recently. Why? Costs catches up with revenue and profit margins diminish, earnings diminish, and so do equity values. This reduces productivity levels and dampens the demand for such commodities. The price drops until demand catches up with the supply. In other words, people reach a cap in terms of how much they are willing to spend on a commodity. Those that produce the commodity reach a particular rate in which that commodity is produced. However, when production costs rise to where it becomes more expensive to produce that same amount of commodity at that rate, either the commodity is forced to be sold at a lower price in order to increase the demand for that commodity, or the production rate of that commodity is lowered in order to balance production costs with profit margins—decreasing the supply. Nevertheless, commodity prices will soar once again. Food prices will also continue to increase. I have warned of these things occurring as early as May 2009. Now I am warning that you will see the US banking and financial sector monopolized. It should not be a surprise. Money magazine confirmed that consolidation of banks and companies will occur. Money magazine also confirmed that in the future there will only be super rich and poor with no middle-class. This was in 1995. This extensive inflationary period will literally break the US economy and other economies that are still directly pegged to the US dollar. This is being done in order to justify <em>creating a new global economic order</em> using an international currency with a global central bank. Keep in mind, that this already exists. The US dollar is the international reserve currency and the US central bank is--at the moment--the global central bank due to the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944. However, the banking elites want a <em>more overt</em> system of control over the global economies. This is why they are <em>deliberately</em> destroying their own banking and financial systems. They want to bring in a universal currency in which the IMF's special drawing rights (SDR's) is a prototype. This is why they are so involved in creating wars and conflict around the globe—to indebt and weaken nations financially in order to enslave them to their banking and financial systems—making them dependent—more so then they are now. The secondary (maybe primary) effect is to reduce the global populations significantly—to create less resistance. However, as it says in the Holy Qur'an: <em>They planned and Allah planned, and Allah is the Best of planners</em>. They are destroying their own economic and financial systems, but they will not get the opportunity to replace it with the more overt system that they envisaged. Many nations are waking up to these schemes and are creating alternatives to the established Western-controlled banking and monetary systems. Soon you will see a reversal of fortunes where the colonized will become the colonizer of the former colonial powers. Actually, you're seeing that now. However, the trump card is that powerful nations like Russia, China, India, and other fast-developing countries are still pegged to the US dollar or the euro.*

(*<em>By the way, I did warn OPEC and the Venezuelan government about the inevitable collapse of the euro in <a href="http://www.mge19.com/opec.pdf" target="_blank">a letter I wrote them on 26 June 2006</a>. George Soros verified what I wrote about the instability of the euro 5 years to the date in <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/26/europe-soros-idUSLDE75P06320110626" target="_blank">this Reuters article</a>.</em>)

This being the case will cause the collapse of their economies as well. I pray Africa is paying attention, because all of the <em>foreign direct investment</em> (FDI) money that they seek will prove to be worthless once the US dollar and the euro collapse. The real wealth is under their feet.

Anyway, let's recap:

i.  The number of independent community banks will soon dwindle in the US due to the intense regulatory environment, monetary factors, and investment limitations.

ii.  Hedge funds will become a thing of the past, and the US dollar and the US economy will soon collapse—as well as the Eurozone economies and all other economies that are still pegged to the US dollar.

This is the future of the world economies in a nutshell. However, there is a solution to all of this: <em>MGE19's Economic Structural Models</em>. Our economic structural models will help any nation to grow from its own domestic wealth—independently. I won't dive into much detail. Just know that we can help a nation achieve economic stability on a permanent basis and economic growth on a perpetual basis while enabling the ordinary citizen to directly benefit from the wealth of their nation. (To learn more, go to <a href="http://www.mge19.com/" target="_blank">http://www.mge19.com</a>, look into PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICES in the SERVICES section.) Most nations' dependency on external economies and the Western-controlled and manipulated currency market is the only reason why economic sanctions are effective. Our economic structural models will help a nation to regain its economic sovereignty and independence.

<em>MGE19 Economic Research and Structural Models is an economic research firm based in the United States that specializes in Predictive Market Analysis (PMA) and economic structural models designed to create economic stability on a permanent basis and perpetual economic growth through monetary and fiscal paradigms. MGE19 has designed the monetary policy for an oil-backed currency in which President Chavez is pushing for OPEC to implement.

Of course, few of them will be editor material, but who knows, if the job could be divided into so many clear tasks, then it would be easy/simple for those specialising to have chosen to volunteer with a specific task: e.g. links, images, headlines, formatting, videos, etc.

Countrywide protests continue against Nato attack

LAHORE: Thousands of people turned out in the streets of Pakistan Friday to denounce the unprovoked Nato attacks of last Saturday that resulted in the deaths of over two dozen Pakistani soldiers. 

Khateebs in Friday sermons condemned the blatant Nato aggression while leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami and other religious parties addressed protest rallies and called for a resolute stand against the aggressor. 

Protest rallies were held in the federal capital, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, Multan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Sargodha, and various other cities and towns. 

Jamaate Islami chief Syed Munawar Hasan in his Friday sermon at the Mansoora mosque, Lahore said the US had begun an undeclared war with Pakistan and its drones had killed thousands of innocent citizens in tribal areas. 

The latest NATO attack, he said, could be termed blatant aggression and terrorism. The workers of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), Lahore also staged a protest rally and appealed to the international community to stop such violations. 

In Rawalpindi, a big rally was staged outside the Press Club, which was addressed by the JI Secretary General Liaqat Baloch, while students of Hamdard University in Islamabad also held a protest rally.

The JI Punjab chief Dr. Syed Waseem Akhtar led the rally in Multan while the Peshawar rally was taken out from the historic Masjid Mahabat Khan and was led by Prof. Muhammad Ibrhaim. 

Various rallies were taken out in all four districts of the Faisalabad division. The protesters were holding national flags, placards and banners inscribed with slogans in favour of the Pak Army and against US and Nato forces. The members of Anjuman-e-Tajran Punjab and Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry gathered at Chowk GTS and shouted slogans in favour of the Pak Army.

In Gujranwala activists of the Jamaatud Dawa and another organisation conducted a rally while another was held from the Jamiat office near Nigar Crossing, which culminated at Sheranwala Bagh.

In Okara the Sunni Tehrik, Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Muslim Students Federation (MSF) held rallies in protest against the Nato attack on the Pakistani check post. In Toba Tek Singh three rallies were held to condemn the Nato attack on Friday. The Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba held a rally from the Government Municipal Degree College. The Shabab-e-Milli also held a rally, which reached the same place. The Jamaat-e-Islami rally started from Civil Lines and reached Shuhada Chowk on Jhang Road.

The journalist community in Tank, Waziristan staged a protest rally in which protesters gathered at the District Press Club and marched to the Kashmir Chowk. The rally was addressed by vice president of the press club, Muhammad Rafiq Arain, and patron-in-chief of the Tank Press Club, Shiakh Ehsanullah. 

The Christian community of Ghalanai, headquarters of the Mohmand Agency, Friday staged a protest against the Nato attack on the Pakistani post. The protesters organised a public meeting at the main gate of the press club. Addressing the protesters, priest Imran Raza condemned the Nato air strike on the Pakistani post and the killing of jawans.

Meanwhile different civil society organisations and unions in Islamabad will organise a protest rally against the Nato attacks on December 8. This was announced by the representatives of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, Islamabad Bar Association, Islamabad Chamber of Commerce, Capital Development Authority (CDA) Labour Union and National Press Club here Friday while addressing a joint press conference at the National Press Club. Zaman Mughal was appointed Chairman of the Joint Action Committee.

The representative of different organisations categorically said no political party flags or banners would be allowed at the demonstrations. “Only the national flag can be brought to the rally,” they remarked.

U.S. NATO Envoy: Missile Shield “Whether Russia Likes It Or Not”

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/03/world/europe/us-official-says-missile-defense-shield-will-move-forward.html

New York Times

U.S. Official Says Missile-Defense Shield Will Move Forward
By Thom Shanker and David M. Herszenhorn

WASHINGTON: The American ambassador to NATO on Friday dismissed recent expressions of outrage from Moscow over proposed missile defenses in Europe, saying that the NATO deployment will proceed “whether Russia likes it or not.”

The ambassador, Ivo Daalder, said the United States was well aware that “there are significant forces within Russia” that believe that the alliance’s system of radars and interceptors could blunt Moscow’s own arsenal of missiles, and thus undermine Russia’s strategic deterrent.

Mr. Daalder said he would meet officials from Moscow at NATO headquarters in Brussels next week to explain — once again — that the alliance shield is designed solely to defend against a potential missile attack from Iran.

…

“Whether Russia likes it or not, we are about defending NATO-European territory against a growing ballistic missile threat,” Mr. Daalder said…

Last week, President Medvedev threatened that Russia would deploy its own missiles and that it could withdraw from the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty if the United States proceeds with its plans for a missile-defense system in Europe.

Returning to that theme this week, Mr. Medvedev dismissed the idea that he was kicking around a political football.

“This statement is not of some tactical nature, not to mention some election nature,” Mr. Medvedev said Thursday at a meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and political supporters, according to the Interfax news agency.

…

Mr. Medvedev said Russia was open to further negotiations, but would be compelled to respond if the United States proceeded in deploying the missile-defense system.

“Our response to the European missile shield will be gradual and its first step was already taken when a radar was activated in the Kaliningrad region,” he said. “More steps will follow if necessary.”

He continued: “Time has not run out to negotiate an agreement. But we also must understand that if the situation develops the old way, we will have to respond. We have material and military prerequisites for that.”

A spokesman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry told reporters on Thursday that the missile-defense issue would be a focus of a meeting between Russian and the NATO council’s foreign ministers on Thursday.

Separately, senior officials in two former Soviet republics, made statements this week in support of Russia’s position. “We share the defense capability concerns and risks of Russia,” President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus told Interfax. “Today we are under the protection of Russia’s nuclear umbrella and if the interests of this umbrella are damaged by any grouping, it means damage and danger for us.”

Meanwhile, the speaker of Parliament in Kyrgyzstan said his government supported Russia’s response and its efforts to negotiate a resolution of the dispute.

Thom Shanker reported from Washington, and David M. Herszenhorn from Moscow.

ThalesRaytheonSystems awarded NATO ALTBMD Interim Capability (InCa) upgrade 

-”Systems such as the Air Command and Control System Level of Operational Capability 1 (ACCS LOC1) and Missile Defence on top of ACCS LOC1 will be critically important to fight as one alliance with warfighters from across the nations trained on common highly interoperable Command and Control systems.”

MASSY, France: ThalesRaytheonSystems (TRS) has been awarded a contract by the NATO Air Command and Control System Management Agency on behalf of the NATO Active Layered Theatre Ballistic Missile Defence (ALTBMD) Programme, to upgrade the operational hardware and software of the ALTBMD Interim Theatre Missile Defence (TMD) Capability (InCa). 

“ThalesRaytheonSystems is committed to supporting this alliance focused approach. Systems such as the Air Command and Control System Level of Operational Capability 1 (ACCS LOC1) and Missile Defence on top of ACCS LOC1 will be critically important to fight as one alliance with warfighters from across the nations trained on common highly interoperable Command and Control systems,” said Jack Harrington, CEO, ThalesRaytheonSystems, during a briefing to NATO and industry participants at the contract signature ceremony in the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. 

TRS was awarded a contract to develop TMD InCa Step 2 in June 2010 and delivered its part of the system to the end users in December of 2010. TRS worked in close cooperation with the NATO’s ALTBMD Programme Office to field TMD InCa Step 2 and again in August 2011 to conduct operational exercises. 

TRS will soon implement additional operator identified requirements to enhance the alliance’s Command and Control capabilities. Under this contract TRS will be upgrading TMD InCa Step 2 to the latest configuration of NATO ACCS. As the world’s first fully integrated C2 system for planning, tasking and execution of air operations, NATO ACCS replaces multiple aging air C2 systems in the NATO nations.

KFOR fortifies position, Serbs stand watch


NATO troops at Jagnjenica (Tanjug)

JAGNJENICA: KFOR troops fortified their camp in Jagnjenica on Friday with large sacks filled with rocks and sand, said reports from northern Kosovo. 

Inside the camp, which stretches to the nearby ethnic Albanian village of Čabra, is a host of army trucks, armored transporters and jeeps, Tanjug is reporting.

From a forest-covered hill above the camp, KFOR troops are videotaping the people gathered at the barricades in Jagnjenica. 

Troops are also posted on top of their vehicles, which they used to block the road leading to Zvećan on Monday, after KFOR had broken through the barricade set up by local Serbs. 

The trucks and buses removed and damaged in this operation can still be seen in Jagnjenica, and inside the circle KFOR has surrounded by barbed wire are several cars left over from KFOR’s last operation. 

In the neighboring village of Zupče, one lane is open for traffic, so passenger cars were are to travel on the road from Kosovska Mitrovica to Ribariće on Friday. 

Protesting Serbs are also standing watch on Friday at other barricades, while the two official administrative crossings in northern Kosovo – Jarinje and Brnjak – remain closed, so the only way between northern Kosovo and central Serbia remain by bypass forest roads.

Genocide Of The Serbian People: Russia To Send Observers To Kosovo

Russia to send observers to Kosovo to protect Serbs

       
The First Deputy Speaker of the Russian Federation Council (the parliament’s upper house) Alexander Torshin says that Russia must closely watch the situation in Kosovo and help ethnic Serbs who are being persecuted by the Kosovo authorities.

“Russia should expand its presence in the Balkans,” he says. “It should send its observers there. The presence of foreign observers will most probably make Kosovo’s authorities think twice before persecuting Serbs.”

“Openness and transparency are very serious matters,” the Russian MP continues. “If an international tribunal on Serbia already exists, an international tribunal on Kosovo will appear sooner or later.”

Mr. Torshin believes that “what is happening in Kosovo looks very much like genocide of the Serbian people”.

Historic Summit: Community Of Latin American, Caribbean States Founded In Venezuela

Community of Latin American States founded in historic summit

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez hosted Friday in Caracas a summit that was to create the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), dpa reported.

The new organization is set to bring together 33 countries with a total population of 550 million. CELAC is to hold the same nations as the Organization of American States (OAS), except for the United States and Canada. Several political analysts have noted that it seeks to replace the Washington-based Organisation of American States (OAS), which was created in 1948.

As he opened the summit, Mexican President Felipe Calderon spoke of the ideal of regional integration that inspired many Latin American independence heroes.

“Today, two centuries later, the ideal still holds and is common to all Latin Americans and Caribbeans. Political, economic, social and cultural integration is a life aspiration, one that is fundamental to our peoples,” Calderon said.

“This is not just about bringing together people, but about rallying Latin Americans and Caribbeans around justice, democracy and civil rights,” he said.

Chavez recalled that the summit had originally been planned for early July, but had to be postponed after he was diagnosed with cancer.

“I give infinite thanks to my God for allowing me to stand here, whole,” Chavez said at the Teresa Carreno theatre in Caracas.

The left-wing populist Venezuelan described the OAS as “something old, a space that was manipulated, dominated by the United States.”

Other countries in the region, however, rather saw CELAC as “complementary” with the OAS, in the words of Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.

As he arrived in Caracas earlier Friday, Cuban President Raul Castro said that the creation of CELAC could be the most important event for the region in 200 years.

“For the first time in history we are going to have an organization that is ours,” Castro said at Caracas airport.

“If it works, if it is successful – it’s not just the fact of creating it and giving it a name – we can regard this as the biggest event in the 200 years of semi-independence we have had so far,” he added.

CELAC is bringing together Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela.

China, Russia Should Halt West’s Rush To War Against Iran

http://www.globaltimes.cn/NEWS/tabid/99/ID/686912/China-not-obliged-to-besiege-Iran.aspx

China not obliged to besiege Iran

[The recent assault on the British embassy in Tehran is far less serious an affair than was the deadly bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade by the U.S. and NATO in 1999, to put matters in perspective  - RR]

The retaliatory revenge from the West ignited by Iranian protesters storming the British embassy on Tuesday is likely to plunge Iran into a bottomless abyss of war.

Western countries demand China follow their lead and slap sanctions on Iran. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China should not comply with the request. Instead it should join hands with Russia to help calm the situation.

The US Senate approved tougher economic sanctions against Iran on Thursday, vowing to penalize any financial institutions that do business with Iran’s central bank. Consequently, other countries such as China, Japan and India are prohibited to conduct oil trade with Iran.

Under such an arrogant bill, it is hard to imagine how the US would borrow money from the central banks of its creditors to make up its bleak budget in the future. China need not pay attention to it.

The incursion in Tehran deserves condemnation, but does not necessarily constitute the subversion of a nation. Here is another case. Though its forces bombed one of Pakistan’s military outposts last week, killing 26 soldiers, NATO has received no punishment.

In Iran’s case, it is understandable the EU imposes sanctions against Iran. But, China has no obligation to mess up the situation especially as the EU and the US try to take the opportunity to overthrow Iran for their own interests.

Iran is an Islamic country with a democratic model, but its ardent religious passion has received little understanding and respect from the West for some time. Conflicts have been mounting because of the nation’s reluctance to take orders from the West, which wants Iran to obey their rules. A country of 70 million people in the Middle East, Iran enjoys the right of living a different way from the West if only because it conforms to the will of its people.

China firmly opposes Iran’s development of nuclear weapons, but will only impose sanctions against the its nuclear-related industries and research on the condition explicit evidence has been found.

For China, the danger of Iran developing nuclear weapons is parallel to the West’s efforts to topple Iran in the name of anti-nuclear weapons.

The West suffers from an economic recession, but its efforts to overthrow non-Western governments due to politics and military interests culminate. China, as well as its mammoth neighbor Russia, should keep on high alert and adopt countermeasures if necessary.

China should not shrink before a possible showdown with the West but seek a solution favoring itself. China will adopt concrete measures to show its determination to take its own path. Such a choice is important for China’s interests.

Russia Supplies Missiles To Syria To Protect Coast

Russia supplied ship killer missiles to Syria
By Vladimir Radyuhin

Russia has supplied ship-killer missiles to Syria in defiance of the growing western demands for an arms embargo against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

Russia has delivered the Bastion anti-ship missile system equipped with Yakhont supersonic missiles to Syria, said Senator Vyacheslav Popov, former Northern Fleet Commander.

Under a 2007 contract, Russia was to supply two Bastion complexes with 72 Yakhont missiles. The fire-and-forget Yakhont with a 300-km range is the Russian version of the Indo-Russian Brahmos missile. The only difference is that Brahmos uses the Indian computer and navigation system.

“This weapon system will enhance Syria’s defence potential,” Mr. Popov told the Interfax news agency on Friday.

Another source quoted by Interfax said the Russian missiles “will be able to protect Syria’s entire coast against a possible attack from the sea.”

A United Nations commission of inquiry on Monday called for an arms embargo on Syria, but Russia rejected the demand.

Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described such calls “dishonest” as they implied an arms cutoff to the Syrian government but not to its opponents. “We know how that worked in Libya when the arms embargo only applied to the Libyan army, whereas the opposition received weapons, and countries like France and Qatar were not embarrassed to admit this publicly,” he said, adding that was time to “stop using ultimatums” to pressure Damascus and seek a political settlement to the conflict.

Next week Russia is dispatching a flotilla of three warships to Syria.

The Central Bureau of Revenue (CBR) officials reportedly circulated a formal letter amongst custom officials in Peshawar and Torkham asking them to stop commercial fuel export to Afghanistan amid the growing price hike in petroleum products and shortage of petroleum in the country, an official of political administration said. 

Sources said that NATO forces stationed in Afghanistan were short of fuel deposits after the government of Pakistan stopped NATO consignments and blocked the fuel supply through the Torkham and Chaman borders.

<em>They buried Bouldergrass today. The cause of death was listed as "media-induced health."</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/brasch/" target="_blank">Walter Brasch</a></strong>

Bouldergrass had begun his health crusade more than a decade ago when he began reading more than the sports pages of his local newspaper, subscribed to his first magazine, and decided TV news could be informative if it didn’t mention anything about wars, famines, and poverty.

Based on what he read and saw in the media, Bouldergrass moved from smog-bound Los Angeles to a rural community in scenic green Vermont, gave up alcohol and a two-pack-a-day cigarette habit, and was immediately hospitalized for having too much oxygen in his body.

To burn off some of that oxygen, he joined America’s “beautiful people” on the jogging paths where the media helped him believe he was sweating out the bad karma. In less than a year, the karma left his body which was now coexisting with leg cramps, fallen arches, and several compressed disks. But at least he was as healthy as all the ads told him he could be.

To make sure he didn’t get skin cancer from being in the sun too long, he slathered four pounds of No. 35 sunblock on his body every time he ran, and went to suntan parlors twice a week to get that “healthy glow” advertisers told him he needed. He stopped blocking when he learned that suntan parlors weren’t good for your health, and that the ingredients in the lotions could cause cancer. So, he wore a jogging suit that covered more skin than an Arab woman’s black chador with veil—and developed a severe case of heat exhaustion.

From ultrathin models and billions of dollars in weight-reducing advertising that told him “thin was in,” he began a series of crash diets. When he was down to 107 pounds, advertising told him he needed to “bulk up” to be a “real man.” So, he began lifting weights and playing racquetball three hours a day. Four groin pulls and seven back injuries later, he had just 6 percent body fat, and a revolving charge account with his local orthopedist.

Several years earlier, Bouldergrass had stopped eating veal as part of a protest of America’s inhumane treatment of animals destined for supermarkets. Now, in an “enlightened” age of health, he gave up all meat, not because of mankind’s cruelty to animals, but because the media revealed that vascular surgeons owned stock in meat packing companies. Besides, it was the “healthy” thing to do.

He gave up pasta when he saw a TV report about the microscopic creepy crawlers that infest most dough.

He gave up drinking soda and began drinking juice, until he read a report that said apple juice had higher than normal levels of arsenic.

He ate soup because it was healthy and so Mmm Mmm Good, until he learned that soup had more salt than Lot’s wife. When he found low-salt soup, he again had a cup a day—until last month when he gave it up because a Harvard study revealed that soup cans contained significant amounts of Bisphenol-A, which can lead to cancer and heart disease.

For a couple of years, lured by a multi-million dollar ad campaign and innumerable articles in the supermarket tabloids, Bouldergrass ate only oat bran muffins for breakfast and a diet of beta carotenes for lunch, until he found himself spending more time in the bathroom than at work. He eliminated the muffins entirely after reading an article that told him eating oatmeal, bran, and hood ornaments from Buick Roadsters were bad for your health.

Bouldergrass gave up milk when he learned that acid rain fell onto pastures and was eaten by cows. When he learned that industrial conglomerates had dumped everything from drinking water to radioactive waste into streams and rivers, he stopped eating fish. For a while, based upon conflicting reports in the media, he juggled low-calorie, low-fat, and low-carbohydrate diets until his body systems dropped into the low end of inertia.

At the movies, he smuggled in packets of oleo to squeeze onto plain popcorn until he was bombarded by news stories that revealed oleo was as bad as butter and that most theatrical popcorn was worse than an all-day diet of sirloin.

When he learned that coffee and chocolate were unhealthy, he gave up an addiction to getting high from caffeine and sugar, and was now forced to work 12-hour days without any stimulants other than the fear of what his children were doing while he was at work.

Unfortunately, he soon had to give up decaffeinated coffee and sugarless candy with cyclamates since both caused laboratory mice to develop an incurable yen to listen to music from the Grand Funk Railroad.

He gave up pizza when the media reported that certain “health care investigators” claimed pizza was little more than junk food. But, he began eating several slices a day to improve his health when Congress, fattened by lobbyists campaigns, last month declared frozen pizza was a vegetable. He figured it made sense, since three decades earlier the Reagan administration had declared catsup to be a vegetable, and five years ago the Department of Agriculture decided butter-coated french fries were a vegetable.

Left with a diet of fruits and vegetables, he was lean and trim. Until he accidentally stumbled across a protest by an environmental group which complained that the use of pesticides on farm crops was a greater health hazard than the bugs the pesticides were supposed to kill. Even the city’s polluted water couldn’t clean off all the pesticides. That’s also when he stopped taking showers, and merely poured a gallon of distilled water over his head every morning.

For weeks, he survived on buckets of vitamins because the magazines told him that’s what he should do. Then, after reading an article that artificial vitamins shaped like the Flintstones caused dinosaur rot, he also gave them up.

The last time I saw Bouldergrass, he was in a hospital room claiming to see visions of monster genetic tomatoes squishing their way toward him. He was mumbling something about cholesterol and high density lipoproteins. Tubes were sticking out of every opening in his emaciated body, as well as a couple of openings that hadn’t been there when he first checked in.

In one last attempt to regain his health, Bouldergrass enlisted in Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move army. But the only movement he was doing was when the nurses flipped him so he wouldn’t get bed sores.

Shortly before he died, he pulled me near him, asked that I write his obit, and in a throaty whisper begged, “Make sure you tell them that thanks to what I learned from the media, I died healthy.”

<em><a href="http://www.walterbrasch.com/">Walter Brasch</a>, a robust figure of health, doesn’t follow anyone’s advice on what is or is not healthy. His latest book is the critically-acclaimed <a href="http://www.greeleyandstone.com/">Before the First Snow</a>, a social issues mystery novel. Brasch says the book is a great Christmas or Chanukah gift, and increased sales will improve his own mental, if not physical, health.</em>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By William Blum</strong>

When the Vietnam War became history, and the protest signs and the bullhorns were put away, so too was the serious side of most protestors' alienation and hostility toward the government. They returned, with minimal resistance, to the restless pursuit of success, and the belief that the choice facing the world was either "capitalist democracy" or "communist dictatorship". The war had been an aberration, was the implicit verdict, a blemish on an otherwise humane American record. The fear felt by the powers-that-be that society's fabric was unraveling and that the Republic was hanging by a thread turned out to be little more than media hype; it had been great copy.

I mention this to explain why I've been reluctant to jump with both feet on the Occupy bandwagon. I first thought that if nothing else the approaching winter would do them in; if not, it would be the demands of their lives — they have to make some money at some point, attend classes somewhere, lovers and friends and family they have to cater to somewhere; lately I've been thinking it's the police that will do them in, writing finis to their marvelous movement adventure — if you hold the system up to a mirror the system can go crazy.

But now I don't know. Those young people, and the old ones as well, keep surprising me, with their dedication and energy, their camaraderie and courage, their optimism and innovation, their non-violence and their keen awareness of the danger of being co-opted their focusing on the economic institutions more than on the politicians or political parties. There is also their splendid signs and slogans, walking from New York to Washington, and not falling apart following the despicable police destruction of the Occupy Wall Street encampment. They've given a million young people other ideas about how to spend the rest of their lives, and commandeered a remarkable amount of media space. The Washington Post on several occasions has devoted full page or near-full page sympathetic coverage. Occupy is being taken increasingly seriously by virtually all media.

Yet, the 1960s and 70s were also a marvelous movement adventure — for me as much as for anyone — but nothing actually changed in US foreign policy as a result of our endless protests, many of which were also innovative. American imperialism has continued to add to its brutal record right up to this very moment. We can't even claim Vietnam as a victory. Most people believe that the US lost the war. But by destroying Vietnam to its core, by poisoning the earth, the water, the air, and the gene pool for generations, Washington in fact achieved its primary purpose: preventing the rise of what might have been a good development option for Asia, an alternative to the capitalist model.

It has greatly helped Occupy's growth and survival that they have seldom mentioned foreign policy. That's much more sensitive ground than corporate abuse. Foreign policy gets into flag-waving, "our brave boys" risking their lives, American exceptionalism, nationalism, patriotism, loyalty, treason, terrorism, "anti-American", "conspiracy theorist" ... all those emotional icons that mainstream America uses to separate a Good American from one who ain't really one of us.

Foreign policy cannot be ignored permanently of course, if for no other reason than that the nation's wealth that's wasted on war could be used to pay for anything Occupy calls for ... or anything anyone calls for.

The education which Occupy has caused to be thrust upon the citizenry — about corporate abuse and criminality, political corruption, inequality, poverty, etc., virtually all unprosecuted — would be highly significant if America were a democracy. But as it is, more and more people can learn more and more about these matters, and get more and more angry, but have nowhere to turn to, to effectuate meaningful change. Money must be removed from the political process. Completely. It is my favorite Latin expression: sine qua non — "without which, nothing".

<strong>USrael and Iran</strong>

There's no letup, is there? The preparation of the American mind, the world mind, for the next gala performance of D&amp;D — Death and Destruction. The Bunker Buster bombs are now 30,000 pounds each one, six times as heavy as the previous delightful model..

But the Masters of War still want to be loved; they need for you to believe them when they say they have no choice, that Iran is the latest threat to life as we know it, no time to waste.

The preparation of minds was just as fervent before the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. And when it turned out that Iraq did not have any kind of arsenal of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) ... well, our power elite found other justifications for the invasion, and didn't look back. Some berated Iraq: "Why didn't they tell us that? Did they want us to bomb them?"

In actuality, before the US invasion high Iraqi officials had stated clearly on repeated occasions that they had no such weapons. In August 2002, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told American newscaster Dan Rather on CBS: "We do not possess any nuclear or biological or chemical weapons." *1

In December, Aziz stated to Ted Koppel on ABC: "The fact is that we don't have weapons of mass destruction. We don't have chemical, biological, or nuclear weaponry." *2

Hussein himself told Rather in February 2003: "These missiles have been destroyed. There are no missiles that are contrary to the prescription of the United Nations [as to range] in Iraq. They are no longer there." *3

Moreover, Gen. Hussein Kamel, former head of Iraq's secret weapons program, and a son-in-law of Saddam Hussein, told the UN in 1995 that Iraq had destroyed its banned missiles and chemical and biological weapons soon after the Persian Gulf War of 1991. *4

There are yet other examples of Iraqi officials telling the world that the WMD were non-existent.

And if there were still any uncertainty remaining, last year Hans Blix, former chief United Nations weapons inspector, who led a doomed hunt for WMD in Iraq, told a British inquiry into the 2003 invasion that those who were "100 percent certain there were weapons of mass destruction" in Iraq turned out to have "less than zero percent knowledge" of where the purported hidden caches might be. He testified that he had warned British Prime Minister Tony Blair in a February 2003 meeting — as well as US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in separate talks — that Hussein might have no weapons of mass destruction. *5

Those of who you don't already have serious doubts about the American mainstream media's knowledge and understanding of US foreign policy, should consider this: Despite the two revelations on Dan Rather's CBS programs, and the other revelations noted above, in January 2008 we find CBS reporter Scott Pelley interviewing FBI agent George Piro, who had interviewed Saddam Hussein before he was executed:
<blockquote><strong>PELLEY</strong>: And what did he tell you about how his weapons of mass destruction had been destroyed?

<strong>PIRO</strong>: He told me that most of the WMD had been destroyed by the U.N. inspectors in the '90s, and those that hadn't been destroyed by the inspectors were unilaterally destroyed by Iraq.

<strong>PELLEY</strong>: He had ordered them destroyed?

<strong>PIRO</strong>: Yes.

<strong>PELLEY</strong>: So why keep the secret? Why put your nation at risk? Why put your own life at risk to maintain this charade? *6</blockquote>
The United States and Israel are preparing to attack Iran because of their alleged development of nuclear weapons, which Iran has denied on many occasions. Of the Iraqis who warned the United States that it was mistaken about the WMD — Saddam Hussein was executed, Tariq Aziz is awaiting execution. Which Iranian officials is USrael going to hang after their country is laid to waste?

Would it have mattered if the Bush administration had fully believed Iraq when it said it had no WMD? Probably not. There is ample evidence that Bush knew this to be the case, or at a minimum should have seriously suspected it; the same applies to Tony Blair. Saddam Hussein did not sufficiently appreciate just how psychopathic his two adversaries were. Bush was determined to vanquish Iraq, for the sake of Israel, for control of oil, and for expanding the empire with new bases, though in the end most of this didn't work out as the empire expected; for some odd reason, it seems that the Iraqi people resented being bombed, invaded, occupied, demolished, and tortured.

But if Iran is in fact building nuclear weapons, we have to ask: Is there some international law that says that the US, the UK, Russia, China, Israel, France, Pakistan, and India are entitled to nuclear weapons, but Iran is not? If the United States had known that the Japanese had deliverable atomic bombs, would Hiroshima and Nagasaki have been destroyed? Israeli military historian, Martin van Creveld, has written: "The world has witnessed how the United States attacked Iraq for, as it turned out, no reason at all. Had the Iranians not tried to build nuclear weapons, they would be crazy." *7

It can not be repeated too often: The secret to understanding US foreign policy is that there is no secret. Principally, one must come to the realization that the United States strives to dominate the world. Once one understands that, much of the apparent confusion, contradiction, and ambiguity surrounding Washington's policies fades away. Examine a map: Iran sits directly between two of the United States' great obsessions — Iraq and Afghanistan ... directly between two of the world's greatest oil regions — the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea areas ... it's part of the encirclement of the two leading potential threats to American world domination — Russia and China ... Tehran will never be a client state or obedient poodle to Washington. How could any good, self-respecting Washington imperialist resist such a target? Bombs Away!

<strong>American exceptionalism — A survey</strong>

The leaders of imperial powers have traditionally told themselves and their citizens that their country was exceptional and that their subjugation of a particular foreign land should be seen as a "civilizing mission", a "liberation", "God's will", and of course bringing "freedom and democracy" to the benighted and downtrodden. It is difficult to kill large numbers of people without a claim to virtue. I wonder if this sense of exceptionalism has been embedded anywhere more deeply than in the United States, where it is drilled into every cell and ganglion of American consciousness from kindergarten on. If we measure the degree of indoctrination (I'll resist the temptation to use the word "brainwashing") of a population as the gap between what the people believe their government has done in the world and what the actual (very sordid) facts are, the American people are clearly the most indoctrinated people on the planet. The role of the American media is of course indispensable to this process — Try naming a single American daily newspaper or TV network that was unequivocally against the US attacks on Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Panama, Grenada, and Vietnam. Or even against any two of them. How about one? Which of the mainstream media expressed real skepticism of The War on Terror in its early years?

Overloaded with a sense of America's moral superiority, each year the State Department judges the world, issuing reports evaluating the behavior of all other nations, often accompanied by sanctions of one kind or another. There are different reports rating how each lesser nation has performed in the previous year in the areas of religious freedom, human rights, the war on drugs, trafficking in persons, and counterterrorism, as well as maintaining a list of international "terrorist" groups. The criteria used in these reports are mainly political, wherever applicable; Cuba, for example, is always listed as a supporter of terrorism whereas anti-Castro exile groups in Florida, which have committed literally hundreds of terrorist acts, are not listed as terrorist groups.
<ul>
	<li>"The causes of the malady are not entirely clear but its recurrence is one of the uniformities of history: power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is peculiarly susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God's favor, conferring upon it a special responsibility for other nations — to make them richer and happier and wiser, to remake them, that is, in its own shining image." — Former US Senator William Fulbright, <em>The Arrogance of Power</em> (1966)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"We Americans are the peculiar, chosen people –– the Israel of our time; we bear the ark of the liberties of the world. ... God has predestined, mankind expects, great things from our race; and great things we feel in our souls." — Herman Melville, <em>White-Jacket</em> (1850)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"God appointed America to save the world in any way that suits America. God appointed Israel to be the nexus of America's Middle Eastern policy and anyone who wants to mess with that idea is a) anti-Semitic, b) anti-American, c) with the enemy, and d) a terrorist." — John le Carré, <em>London Times</em>, January 15, 2003</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"Neoconservatism ... traded upon the historic American myths of innocence, exceptionalism, triumphalism and Manifest Destiny. It offered a vision of what the United States should do with its unrivaled global power. In its most rhetorically-seductive messianic versions, it conflated the expansion of American power with the dream of universal democracy. In all of this, it proclaimed that the maximal use of American power was good for both America and the world." — Columbia University Professor Gary Dorrien, <em>The Christian Century magazine</em>, January 22, 2007</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"To most of its citizens, America is exceptional, and it's only natural that it should take exception to certain international standards." — Michael Ignatieff, <em>Washington Post</em> columnist, <em>Legal Affairs</em>, May-June, 2002.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters, US Army War College, 1997: "Our country is a force for good without precedent".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Thomas Barnett, US Naval War College: "The US military is a force for global good that ... has no equal." — <em>The Guardian</em> (London), December 27, 2005</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>John Bolton, future US ambassador to the United Nations, writing in 2000: Because of its unique status, the United States could not be "legally bound" or constrained in any way by its international treaty obligations. The U.S. needed to "be unashamed, unapologetic, uncompromising American constitutional hegemonists," so that their "senior decision makers" could be free to use force unilaterally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Condoleezza Rice, future US Secretary of State, writing in 2000, was equally contemptuous of international law. She claimed that in the pursuit of its national security the United States no longer needed to be guided by "notions of international law and norms" or "institutions like the United Nations" because it was "on the right side of history." — <em>Z Magazine</em>, July/August 2004</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"The president [George W. Bush] said he didn't want other countries dictating terms or conditions for the war on terrorism. 'At some point, we may be the only ones left. That's okay with me. We are America'." — <em>Washington Post</em>, January 31, 2002</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"Reinhold Niebuhr got it right a half-century ago: What persists — and promises no end of grief — is our conviction that Providence has summoned America to tutor all of humankind on its pilgrimage to perfection." — Andrew Bacevich, professor of international relations, Boston University</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>In commenting on Woodrow Wilson's moral lecturing of his European colleagues at the Versailles peace table following the First World War, Winston Churchill remarked that he found it hard to believe that the European emigrants, who brought to America the virtues of the lands from which they sprang, had left behind all their vices. — <em>The World Crisis, Vol. V, The Aftermath</em>, 1929</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"Behold a republic, gradually but surely becoming the supreme moral factor to the world's progress and the accepted arbiter of the world's disputes." — William Jennings Bryan, US Secretary of State under Woodrow Wilson,<em> In His Image</em> (1922)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>Newsweek</em> editor Michael Hirsch: "U.S. allies must accept that some U.S. unilateralism is inevitable, even desirable. This mainly involves accepting the reality of America's supreme might — and truthfully, appreciating how historically lucky they are to be protected by such a relatively benign power." — <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, November, 2002</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Colin Powell speaking before the Republican National Convention, August 13, 1996: The United States is "a country that exists by the grace of a divine providence."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"The US media always has an underlying acceptance of the mythology of American exceptionalism, that the US, in everything it does, is the last best hope of humanity." — Rahul Mahajan, author of: <em>The New Crusade: America's War on Terrorism</em>, and <em>Full Spectrum Dominance</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"The fundamental problem is that the Americans do not respect anybody except themselves," said Col. Mir Jan, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry. "They say, 'We are the God of the world,' and they don't consult us." —<em>Washington Post</em>, August 3, 2002</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>"If we have to use force, it is because we are America! We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall. We see further into the future." — Madeleine Albright, U.S. Secretary of State, 1998</li>
</ul>

<em>The European Union was never about Democracy and the Euro project was and is a spectacular own goal.</em>

<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong>Pravda.Ru</strong>

The European Union was never about Democracy and therefore it comes as divine justice that the ball which represents the Eurozone crisis was kicked off by a currency sculpted graphically around the Greek letter epsilon and rolls back, precisely, to Greece. The Euro project was and is a spectacular own goal.

Around eighty years ago, the genius Albert Einstein said you cannot subjugate a nation forcibly. He was right. In the case of the European Union, and more specifically that of the 17 Eurozone member states, the mistake was repeated 17-fold. And a mistake it was, because it was not implemented democratically, it was imposed in a holier-than-thou, top-down and arrogant approach whereby a few thousand senseless Eurocrats mindlessly stitched together a laboratory experiment and implemented it wholly and completely against the collective will of Europe’s citizens, who wanted nothing less than a general trading agreement but certainly also nothing more than that.

And the epitome of this folly is that the world’s financial experts are answering the three-word question “What will happen?” with four: “I do not know”. So, in their wisdom, these faceless morons imposed a laboratory financial and economic system, in ten years, on the collective economic and social history of a continent with 500 million people, based upon developmental vectors spanning back some five thousand years, then in their enlightenment unbalanced these economies by financing countries not to produce or to destroy their agriculture, industry and fishing sectors, poisoning the job-breeding terrain downstream and now that the whole fiasco blows up in their faces, they do not know the solution, neither does the system provide one?

The urge to write a string of expletives is huge, the need to write something more productive is more pressing.

The bottom line resides in the fundamentals of the system. In the Socialist economies, resources belonged to the State, including human assets, and as such did not need to be “paid for” in a monetary sense. The idea was that the resources of nations would be exploited and provided by the State for the people, as indeed it was translated into, in terms of free housing, subsidised or free utilities, free or subsidised public transportation, basic necessities, free universal education and healthcare, guaranteed job and indexed pensions.

However, the EU is not based upon these fundamentals, it is based upon the most vicious stresses involved in a market-based economy where the field is slanted very much in favour of corporate giants, where state interventionism needs to occur to balance the books every now and then and where the cards are fixed against the small businessman. Add to that an absence of far-seeing economic and financial management, add to that a climate of corporate greed, insert this into a globalised economy and we have the nightmare scenario which is looming before our very eyes.

These mis-managers have (mis)managed to get their countries’ economies caught in the inevitable downward spiral of those cocooned in endemic debt (borrowing from one credit card to pay the interest on the other), have therefore been spending more than they earn, have allowed the credit rating of their countries to be ruled by ratings agencies (instead of permitting a bilateral contract between debtor and creditor) and now, have begun to seek emergency loans – which have a sting in the tail. As time goes on, creditor confidence in the debtors goes into free-fall and repayment interest coupons skyrocket. This situation is not sustainable.

When a country is indebted, it has to take money out of its economy to make credit payments, meaning its economy contracts. Jobs are lost, which engender further job losses and bankruptcies down the line as consumer confidence and then spending decrease, tax revenues fall, the need for state subsidies (unemployment benefit, early retirement pensions, healthcare needs) rises and the way out is higher taxation (not a good idea on populations pushed to breaking point) or further loans, compounding the problem further.

Throw in to this horrific scenario the fact that the financial institutions had been investing heavily in toxic products (high-interest schemes based upon high rates of risk, which work when the economy is spiralling upwards but collapse when it starts to spiral back downwards), throw in the insurance and reinsurance policies taken about on these products, throw in the contagion that a globalised economy entails and we begin to see that our beloved leaders have been literally gambling our futures away, throwing money they did not have into an under-regulated growing vortex, a financial hole so deep that nobody today understands the measure of the monster we are facing.

Let us take a look at Greece. The first bail-out package worth around 210 billion Euro in 2010 vaporised (yet Greece is still liable for its repayment). None of the subsequent measures – the creation of the European Stabilisation Mechanism (500 million Euro), European Central Bank loans, special loans offered by the Merkozy space (Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Nicolas Sarkozy appear as Europe’s all powerful dynamic duo) and the IMF – appear to have made any difference, simply because Greece’s repayment coupon on what it already owed has risen exponentially and as to how the country is supposed to pay off hundreds of billions of Euro in increased debt, forget it.

When Greece’s Prime Minister decided to be democratic, for a change, and ask the people of Greece what they wanted to do in a referendum, he was howled down by the Merkozy space and the horrified leaders of the world community. December, 2011: Democracy, ladies and gentlemen, does not exist.

Greece is the tip of the iceberg. Portugal, Italy, Spain and Ireland are not far behind, Germany and France, the Merkozy space, are not immune.

<strong>What to do?</strong>

Since our illuminated leaders “do not know” and since our illustrious economists refuse to do what they are supposed to do, namely come up with some ideas, then let us set the ball rolling here. For a start, contrary to a lot of nonsense espoused in the media, the mechanism for leaving the Eurozone is perfectly clear, set out in Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon. All a country has to do is declare its intention to leave to the European Council, which in turn will issue the terms of exit agreed upon by a majority decision of the members (Heads of Government). Where Maastricht (1992) and Lisbon (2007) are not clear is as to whether a state could leave the Eurozone but remain within the European Union. Where there is a will, there is a way.

This “nuclear option” of leaving the Euro would incur short-term consequences, since a “new Drachma” (or Peseta/Escudo/Punt/Lira) would devalue, prices would rise and current agreements such as mortgages would enter a legal abyss of re-denomination procedures into the new currency. It would also afford the “victim” the luxury of taking control of its own fiscal, financial, monetary and economic policies which it signed away when it joined the Euro bandwagon, providing leverage gained by printing more money and devaluing the currency. It would also provide the means to use this new-found autonomy to build an internal economy, recovering the lost agricultural, industrial and fishing sectors, paying farmers to produce instead of burying their crops and providing the basis for the economy to be more competitive, create more jobs and raise more revenue through taxation.

If everyone kept a level head and implemented goodwill measures, then the re-denomination process, pegging the new currency over a period of time during an induction phase with special parameters, need not be too costly.

Another measure is the Eurobond, in which the seventeen Eurozone member states would guarantee each others’ debts (bonds) and which would allow all members to borrow money on the same basis with the same interest rates. While Germany might oppose this, feeling “used” as less efficient economies jumped on her vastly superior credibility = credit rating, it is also true that the measures the Merkozy space implemented roughshod on the rest of Europe over the last two decades created the problem in the first place. You cannot expect Portugal, for instance, to dance to the same tune as Germany if you do not give Portuguese workers German (dancers’) salaries. And why should they?

Germany’s fears that her own borrowing costs would rise as a result (as her credit rating was diluted among the other Eurozone members) could be to a certain extent assuaged by an idea from the Breugel Think Tank, namely to reach a compromise whereby the Eurobond would cover debts equal to 60 per cent of a country’s GDP per annum, meaning that debts in addition to this would have to be subordinated to EU law, meaning in turn that the relatively easy-to-cover 60% would take pride of place. This would dissuade countries from indebting themselves further (above this threshold) and would also dissuade creditors from lending into what could be a high-risk toxic area.

Without the Eurobond, the only other option is either the collapse of the “Eurozone” idea (in which an intelligent approach would allow the members to go their own separate ways and in which the financial system would agree to “freeze” certain measures, using goodwill over greed) or else a revolutionary idea practised on the other side of the Atlantic, namely for the European Central Bank to simply print more Euros.

For that, we go back to the precept that for a single currency to be effective, you need a single state. Since that is not going to happen, since the ratings agencies are not going to disappear overnight, since the Eurozone countries in trouble are merely postponing the inevitable, because they are liable for their existing debts at increased rates and will suffer the effects of the IMF cure which kills the host before the disease, then the writing is on the wall.

My prognosis is that the Eurobond will be the short-term measure which enables the ship to weather this storm, however you can only patch up holes for so long before the fabric tears. Given that in those countries already heavily in debt because their economies were destabilised by Eurospace and then Eurozone membership, either there is a revolution in Euro affairs or else the entire project goes down the sewer.

Next time, do not implement policies too fast and too far without asking people what they want. It is called, in a word, Democracy, and Democratic is something which the Merkozy space is not and never has been.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Iran Cautions Oil Ban Sends World Prices to over $250</title>

<em>Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehman-Parast: "As soon as such an issue is raised seriously, the oil price would soar to above $250 a barrel."</em>

Iran cautioned that any Western attempt to block its oil exports would send global crude prices soaring high above $250 per barrel.

Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ramin Mehman-Parast said if the West seriously considers blocking Tehran's ability to export oil, the global price of crude would more than double.

"As soon as such an issue is raised seriously, the oil price would soar to above $250 a barrel," Mehman-Parast told the Persian-language daily, <em>Sharq</em>, on Sunday.

Many world analysts have warned that they perceive a price for oil somewhere between $200 to $300 per barrel in case action is taken against Iran.

Only words about US efforts to convince the EU to impose sanctions against Iranian oil exports sent the global prices higher on Friday (December 2) although a day earlier on Thursday a hot debate over embargos on Iranian oil supplies among the EU member states failed to produce any result. Oil rose towards $110 a barrel on Friday as the US and its Western allies discussed sanctions on Iran.

Despite a long hue and cry about new sanctions against Iran, the EU and the US could only enlist some more Iranian officials in their sanctions list on Thursday. Several members of the European bloc voiced opposition to any sanction on Iranian oil, pushing France, the most hawkish EU member, back.

Crisis-hit Greece has said 'No' to an EU oil ban on Iran, causing relief among other member states. Britain and France, the most hawkish EU countries, failed to convince other member states to impose oil embargos on Iran.

The developments took place at an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on Thursday, December 1.

Iran is a major energy exporters and presides over the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).]]></content:encoded>

<em>Mathaba est en mesure de confirmer que les déclarations dans les médias attribuées à Aïcha al-Kadhafi (photo d'archives) font partie d'un complot en vue de son expulsion d'Algérie, sa capture ou son assassinat.</em>

Après avoir déclaré le "succès" de l'opération militaire américano-européenne de l'<abbr title="Organisation du Traité de l'Alliance de l'Atlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">OTAN</abbr>, donnant la victoire au régime d'occupation du CNT interrompant la démocratie du peuple libyen (Jamahiriya) et préparant une invasion de la Syrie, l'objectif du global <a href="http://wiki.mathaba.net/Media">Media</a> est de cacher le rôle de l'OTAN dans la démolition de la Libye.

Il devrait être rappelé que la guerre contre la Libye a été, en grande partie, rendue possible par la couverture médiatique de fausses nouvelles, exercée par les services secrets américains et l'opposition libyenne en exil qui ont diffusé de faux rapports via Twitter et des appels téléphoniques anonymes, diffusés par des médias arabes du Golfe hostiles à Qaddafi, qui ont à leur tour été repris par les sociétés médiatiques occidentales "crédibles" comme la BBC, CNN et Reuters qui citaient les médias arabes et non la source originale (des faux comptes Twitter ou des appels téléphoniques anonymes). De cette façon les mensonges flagrants ont été blanchi et sont devenu comme des preuves, frayant la voie au Conseil de Sécurité de l'ONU et autres décideurs politiques et militaires pour donner à l'OTAN le feu vert pour détruire un des systèmes sociaux-économiques les <a href="http://bit.ly/libyatruth">plus avancés</a> dans le monde et ses <a href="http://bit.ly/libyamusic">réalisations</a>, qui étaient devenus une menace pour l'hégémonie des banquiers occidentaux sur l'Afrique.

La couverture et la déformation des actions de l'Armée Libyenne et des volontaires de la résistance "verte" libyenne pour la libération de la Libye des envahisseurs, sont conçus pour consolider la situation en essayant de confondre et démoraliser la résistance. Toute mention médiatique de la présence d'équipes de L'OTAN en Libye est aussi filtrée, de même que les terribles crimes engagés par l'OTAN et leurs mercenaires sur le terrain qui filment leurs atrocités avec leurs téléphones portables et les publient ensuite sur YouTube. Ils continuent ainsi à terroriser impunément les civils et créent des camps de la mort pour ceux qui ne soutiennent pas le régime imposé du "CNT", la grande majorité de la population libyenne qui n'a plus de voix. Une autre de ces cibles est la famille Qaddafi et ces jours-ci, ceux qui résident en Algérie en tant que réfugiés (plus ci-dessous).
<div>

Par ailleurs, l'un des principaux objectif du Global Média <abbr title="L'argent esclave Médias alias Main Stream"><a href="http://wiki.mathaba.net/Media">MSM</a> </abbr>est de créer une atmosphère de confusion et de mensonges autour de la résistance libyenne à la fois du côté libyen que du côté de toutes les personnes de bonne volonté qui essaient de lutter contre les occupants et leur propagande. Pour atteindre cet objectif, les <a href="http://wiki.mathaba.net/Media">médias</a> font usage gratuitement de fausse vidéos, photos et rapports au sujet de la capture de Libyens célèbres soit en Libye ou dans le monde. Un excellent exemple de cela est l'assassinat présumé du colonel Mouammar Kadhafi, qui nous permet de confirmer une nouvelle fois que ce dernier est en sécurité et en bonne santé, et aussi les diverses déclarations attribuées à la famille Kadhafi et à la résistance. Le but est de s'assurer que la résistance est faible et ne peut pas protéger ses dirigeants, de créer une impression que chaque personne qui serait déclarée chef de la résistance serait instantanément trahie et capturée par <abbr title=" Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">l'OTAN </abbr>ou ses marionnettes du CNT.

Un autre objectif des nombreux faux rapports d'information (car les communications ont été largement coupées entre la Jamahiriya libyenne ainsi que la famille Kadhafi et le mouvement vert libyens, depuis la trahison et l'invasion de Tripoli le 21 août, et la destruction des citées libyennes et des villes qui avaient refusées d'accepter le régime dictatorial imposé par l'étranger), est d'initier la discussion entre la communauté mondiale, la faisant focaliser à s'opposer simplement à l'agression de l'OTAN au lieu d'aborder <a href="http://wiki.mathaba.net/Media">les crimes contre l'humanité des médias </a> et <abbr title="Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne"> de l'OTAN</abbr> et <a href="http://peoplesconference.org/cah">présenter à un procès ceux qui ont commis ces crimes bien documentés.</a>

De plus, le Global Média peut propager des mensonges à travers les médias complaisants des petits Etats arabes, qu'il contrôlent facilement et au sein desquels ils ont des éditeurs dévoués en charge de la désinformation. Après cela, toutes les «nouvelles» font écho à travers tous les médias du monde entier sans esprit critique. Il est malheureusement courant que les gens commencent à croire à ces énormes mensonges provenant de diverses source médiatiques, dont les consommateurs de nouvelles ne réalisent pas qu'ils émanent d'une source unique, et non de dizaines comme elles apparaissent à leurs yeux, puisque les réseaux ne mentionnent presque jamais la véritable source originale.

Beaucoup de personnes sont naïves de penser que ce qui est écrit dans différents médias est forcément vrai. Ils ne se rendent pas compte que ce "plan" a été mis en oeuvre pendant "la guerre froide" avec un grand succès de propagande dans la vente des médias capitalistes occidentaux "libres" et "démocratiques", malgré  le fait que leur propriété soit concentré et compromise par leur propre agenda comme feuille de route du capitalisme mondial et "du nouvel ordre mondial" pour solidifier le contrôle des sociétés globalistes. Ils ne se rendent pas non plus compte que le mouvement de la Jamahiriya à travers le monde a toujours <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/about">une source indépendante de nouvelles et d'informations</a>, qui a jusqu'à présent résisté à la censure par ses compétences techniques pure et son intransigeante détermination.

<strong>Nouveau complot contre Aïcha Kadhafi</strong>

Ayant donné une illusion que la majeur partie de la famille Kadhafi et du gouvernement légitime de la Libye (système de la démocratie directe de la Jamahiriya) sont soit morts ou soit capturés, Global <a href="http://wiki.mathaba.net/Media">Média</a> en collaboration avec <abbr title="Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">l'OTAN </abbr>planifie un frappe imminente sur ceux qui continuent de résister, avec un plan de diffusion de vidéos et de photos ou Aïcha Kadhafi aurait été expulsée d'Algérie et capturée. <span>Pour atteindre cet objectif, de faux rapports et vidéos de Aisha, déclarant que les membres vivants de la famille de Kadhafi sont morts, ont été réparties à travers le net mondial par <abbr title="Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">l'OTAN</abbr> et le tout avalé en bloc par les réseaux médiatiques d'informations et de nouvelles étrangers, y compris ceux qui prétendent être du côté de la résistance. Ce complot est une tentative flagrante de capturer Aisha Kadhafi, qui est considérée par beaucoup comme le véritable héritier du leadership révolutionnaire de Mouammar Al-Kadhafi, en la faisant expulser d'Algérie.</span>

<em><strong>Le fait est que des sources très fiables de Mathaba révèlent que Aïcha n'a pas fait de discours, ni de communiqués et cela à aucun médias.</strong></em> Par ailleurs, elle avait été réduite au silence par les autorités algériennes qui, comme  condition de séjour en Algérie, lui avait apparemment interdit de parler aux médias peu après son arrivée avec deux de ses frères, sa mère, et des amis de la famille. <span>Elle est donc incapable de se défendre contre les faux messages qui lui sont attribués, qui revendiquent la mort de son père et deux de ses frères et la capture d'un tiers. Mathaba confirme qu'elle n'a fait aucune déclaration telle que diffusée par Al-Rai TV, non seulement parce que nous en aurions été informés comme d'habitude mais aussi parce que son contenu est manifestement faux. </span><span>Par conséquent les autorités algériennes, si elles souhaitent obtenir de l'aide de toute bonne personne dans le monde quand viendra leur tour d'être la cible de <abbr title="Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">l'OTAN</abbr>, ainsi que par respect aux principes humanitaires de base et principes légaux, ne doivent pas expulser Aïcha, ni lui permettre de se voir "revendiquer" telles fausses déclarations dans les médias autres que le sien.</span>

<span><span>Des messages attribués au ministère algérien des Affaires étrangères circulent actuellement dans lesquels il déclare que Aisha a violé ses conditions de séjour en Algérie, en préparant ainsi la voie à son expulsion. Compte tenu de l'histoire des organisations internationales et des droits de l'homme à travers la destruction sanglante de la Libye et l'assassinat estimé de plus de 100 000 Libyens, quelqu'un mettant Aisha n'importe où près de la Libye se rendrait complice d'assassinat et serait en violation par rapport aux Droits de l'Homme et toutes les Règles de Justice.</span></span>

D'autres sources fiables ont indiqué que d'ici deux jours et probablement dès aujourd'hui, dimanche 4 Décembre au matin (heure de New York) ou le soir (heure de l'Europe / Afrique), il apparaîtra un plan visant à l'arrestation de Aisha Kadhafi près de la frontière de la Libye avec l'Algérie. Les Photos et vidéos montrant Aisha en état d'arrestation sont déjà achevées, et ont été préparées à l'avance, selon ces sources.

La réalisation de ce type de fausses vidéos et photos, facilement falsifiables dans le monde numérique d'aujourd'hui sont diffusées chaque jour par l'industrie cinématographique Hollywoodienne à des fins de divertissement, mais beaucoup ne réalisent pas que c'est désormais également le cas pour la plupart des bulletins d'information sur la Libye au cours de ces 10 derniers mois, et que cela va forcer plusieurs personnes à conclure que la résistance n'existe pas parce qu'elle n'a pas pu protéger la fille de Kadhafi et peut-être également afin de compromettre l'Algérie, et aussi faire en sorte que les Libyens en général et leurs nombreux supporters à travers le monde se sentent désespérés et déçus.

<span><span>Mouammar Al-Kadhafi avait déjà appelé ses partisans à se préparer à ces mensonges et à ne pas arrêter la lutte contre l'<abbr title="Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">OTAN</abbr>.</span></span>

La guerre de l'information et de la guérilla contre <abbr title="Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">l'OTAN</abbr>, qui contrôle le ciel libyen, les médias et les réseaux de communication, doit être répartie sur le net sans siège déclarée parce que le siège peut être éliminé par les forces militaires. <span>Beaucoup de ceux qui soutiennent la Libye ne réalisent pas que chaque action doit être bien préparée et </span><span><span>qu'il faut du temps, sous le siège de l'information en particulier depuis la fin Août les gens pensent que la résistance en Libye n'existe pas.  Ils ne peuvent pas apprécier les rapports disant que les tribus qui avaient précédemment soutenu <abbr title="Conseil national de transition (CNT / CNC)">le CNT </abbr>ont tourné leurs armes contre ce dernier.</span></span>

Pour détruire la foi en la résistance parmi les Libyens et leurs partisans qui luttent ensemble avec les Libyens contre les médias de l'<abbr title="Organisation du traité de l'Attlantique Nord - Alliance Militaire américano-européenne">OTAN</abbr> et Global Media dans les deux prochains jours, l'intrigue de l'arrestation d'Aïcha pourrait être diffusée par les <a href="http://wiki.mathaba.net/Media">canaux médiatiques</a> habituels et retransmise par les blogueurs sans méfiance et les activistes des médias sociaux. Ne faites pas confiance à tous ceux qui nous ont menti dès le début et continuent de le faire, la guerre médiatique contre le peuple du monde, et le peuple de la Libye, est en cours.

<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

The message from the Bonn Conference on Afghanistan on December 5 was that the world is standing by the people of Afghanistan, looking for a political and social solution to this country’s problems and not a military one. Part of the solution is to involve women at all levels of the reconstruction and reconciliation process.

Development, not deployment. This was the central message coming from the c. 1,000 delegates from 100 countries at the end of the Bonn Conference on Afghanistan December 5 – a Conference which would not have been necessary had the west not armed, aided and abetted the Mujaheddin terrorists which were unleashed against the most socially progressive governments the country has known in its history, which were in turn supported by the Soviets. Finally however, after decades of terrorism and instability, generations brought up on hatred and criminal activity, there is light at the end of the tunnel and Afghanistan has, in the words, of German Foreign Minister Westerwelle, “clear and long-term prospects”.

These prospects are based upon Kabul’s pledge to do more to provide good governance and to fight against corruption while the international community looks forward to 2014 when combat troops will be removed and when finally a process of development, rather than deployment, starts to be pursued.

This new decade of development for Afghanistan will be based upon a reconciliation process founded on three clear principles: the renunciation of terrorism, the renunciation of violence and the respect for human rights. Negotiation and reconciliation will be the key words, as military deployment is dropped and the key players will not be the United States and NATO member countries but very much India, Pakistan, IR Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and the PR China, Afghanistan’s neighbours.

No process, however, will be successful if it does not involve Afghanistan’s women as key contributors at every level of the process as responsibility is transferred to the Afghan people over the next decade. Here, it is crucial that women’s rights organizations worldwide network with their Afghani counterparts to ensure their full involvement in the process, defending and protecting gender equality in a country where in the last decades women’s rights (defended by the Soviets) were swept away.

<strong>UN Women</strong> highlights the courage of Afghanistan’s women on the road to recovery leading up to yesterday’s conference.

<strong>Note from UN Women:</strong>

UN Women Urges Full Participation of Afghan Women in the Road Ahead from Bonn.

<em><strong>Commends sustained efforts of Afghan women and their engagement at the international conference.</strong></em>

<strong>United Nations, New York</strong> — On 5 December 2011, Afghan women joined the more than 1,000 delegates from 100 countries attending the Bonn Conference on Afghanistan to discuss the transfer of responsibility for security to the Afghan government in the coming years. Ten years since the first Bonn Conference, the voice and position of Afghan women’s civil society remain among the most progressive and prominent in the national debates on Afghanistan’s development and the protection of human rights in the country.

As the Bonn Conference draws to an end, UN Women applauds the determined efforts of Afghan women activists who have worked relentlessly to ensure that gender equality issues remain on the agenda of Afghanistan’s Peace and Transition process.

In the lead-up to Bonn, the efforts of national gender equality advocates in government and civil society, such as the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and the Afghan Women’s Network (AWN), have resulted in a broad-based consensus among Afghan women on their role and their expectations within the Transition and Peace processes. More visible results were a marked increase in the number of women in the official delegation to Bonn as well as a strong representation of women within civil society delegations. These efforts were supported by the United Nations in Afghanistan, with the strong support of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General and UN Women as the lead entity on gender equality.

Over the past ten years, Afghan women and the Government of Afghanistan have made remarkable advances, with the adoption of a 25-percent quota in the national constitution resulting in 25 percent women in the current Parliament, and the adoption of laws and policies to combat gender-based violence and to advance gender equality. Yet the challenges that Afghan women face are considerable. A recent study by the Afghan Ministry of Women’s Affairs and women’s groups reports that approximately 57 percent of girls in Afghanistan are married before the age of 16. The estimated literacy rate for women stands at 15.8 percent. Currently women remain marginalized in peace and transition efforts — for example women constitute only 12.8 percent of the High Peace Council.

Emerging from today’s Conference in Bonn, Afghan women hope to see stronger and more robust measures by national and local governments towards gender equality and a renewed commitment to implement the national action plan for women. Women from across the country are demanding a more inclusive peace process that gives women an active role in monitoring of reintegration efforts, and that security of women — which continues to be a daily threat in public and private spaces — becomes a top priority for national and international actors in Afghanistan. Civil society organizations and networks are calling for more than just a seat at the table — with reintegration efforts often targeting the worst perpetrators against women’s rights, they want to actively monitor peace and integration processes and provide feedback on what is working on the ground.

Over these past five months, with UN Women’s support, the Afghan Women’s Network (AWN) has brought women throughout the country together in preparation for Bonn, to put their priorities and concerns on the table. During the conference, gender equality advocates laid out a comprehensive set of recommendations, ranging from demanding a more transparent and rigorous recruitment process for the Afghan National Security Forces and local police involving women’s groups and women community leaders, to requesting government to prioritize the protection of women leaders, to ensuring the allocation of 25–30 percent of the Afghan Peace and Reintegration Programme budget for initiatives impacting women’s and girls’ access to quality education and health services, access to agricultural programmes, vocational training and other economic empowerment initiatives.

Afghan women called for an international community that is willing to make long-term commitments beyond 2014 to advance the situation of Afghan women and girls, by expanding and protecting their access to education, their economic security, their right to live free of violence, and to determine their roles and their future. As one of the Afghan women said: “Men and women are two wings of the same bird. If one wing is broken, the bird cannot take off and fly.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17411" title="african prisoners libya 01" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/african-prisoners-libya-01.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="318" />
<em>For almost ten months now, Black Libyans and other Black Africans have been the victims of massacres, torture, shooting, abuse and humiliation.</em>

"The treatment was inhuman," said Doctor Osama Mussa, as the prison guards around him looked uneasy.

"They burnt people with cigarettes, beat their feet, hung men by their arms – look here," he said, showing dark swollen rings and scars around his and other prisoners’ wrists and arms.

"They put people in single cells. This man had his toenails pulled out," the jailed doctor said.

Doctor Mussa's testimony makes uncomfortable listening for the mainstream media journalists, as it describes the treatment meted out not by so-called Gaddafi loyalists, but by Libya's Western-backed "democratic" rebels.

It comes as the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon prepares to release a report that says 7,000 "pro-Gaddafi prisoners" are languishing in Libya, often in makeshift private jails, without legal process.

The UN has also expressed alarm at reports of abuse and torture. Dr Mussa made his claims on November 24, hijacking a tour organised to show how well prisoners in Khoms, 90km east of Tripoli, were being treated. Instead, the 34-year-old prominent Jamahiriya supporter and other prisoners insisted they had suffered systematic abuse.

The UN report says that many of those detained are black Africans, held because of their skin colour, following media lies that Gaddafi used "mercenaries recruited from sub-Saharan Africa."

The report said that many of those in custody are simply economic migrants who held jobs in Libya and were caught up in the American-European war against the country.

"Some detainees have reportedly been subjected to torture and ill treatment," the report said.

For almost ten months now, Black Libyans and other Black Africans have been the victims of massacres, torture, shooting, abuse and humiliation.

"The truth is that Gaddafi had sympathy for black Africans", a Nigerian man who lives in Libya said. "In fact, there is a city in Southern Libya called Suyima that is mostly populated by Nigerians, especially the <em>Hausa</em>. The city shares borders with Algeria and Niger. But due to Gaddafi's sympathy for the blacks, the Libyan rebels consider the blacks as their enemies and decided to kill any black man they come across."

A resident of Bani Walid reported to <em>Reuters</em> on condition of anonymity for fear of the rebels: "Under Gaddafi everything was great and now there's nothing. They will find me. Anyone who tells the truth in Libya gets slaughtered."

<em>Iran has shot down over a dozen US drones during the last few years.</em>

Iran's response to US spy drones will not be limited to the country's borders, a military source said after Iranian armed forces shot down another US spy drone yesterday.

"Given the flagrant violation of our country's borders, the electronic and operational actions of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Armed Forces against the enemy planes will not be limited to the country's borders," an Iranian official told FNA.

The official had also informed FNA on Sunday afternoon that the country's forces had downed a US RQ-170 Sentinel drone over the Eastern parts of the country.

"An advanced RQ-170 unmanned American spy plane was shot down by Iran's armed forces. It suffered minor damage and is now in possession of Iran's Armed Forces," a military official told FNA on Sunday.

In similar remarks, military sources told Iran's Arabic language Al Alam television that Tehran will intensify its response to the United States' spying operations.

"The Iranian military's response to the American spy drone's violation of our airspace will not be limited to Iran's borders any more," a military source told Al Alam, without giving details.

After a day of silence, both Pentagon and NATO officials acknowledged the shooting down of their Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in eastern Iran, alleging that the aircraft with a mission to fly over western Afghanistan had gone astray.

The drone had been downed with help from the Iranian military's electronic warfare unit.

The military official warned of a strong and crushing response to any violations of the country's airspace by American drone aircraft.

RQ-170 Sentinel is made by Lockheed Martin and is used for highly important, top secret missions. The UAV was used to keep watch on Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan as the raid that killed him was taking place earlier this year.

The surveillance aircraft is equipped with stealth technology, but the US Air Force has not made public any specifics about the drone.

Iran has shot down over a dozen US drones during the last few years.

In January, Iranian forces shot down two pilotless US spy planes over the country's airspace, and after Washington denied the shooting down of its drones, Tehran offered to put them on public display.

In July, Iranian military officials showed Russian experts several US drones shot down in Iran in recent years.

Also in July, Iranian lawmaker Ali Aghazadeh Dafsari said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) had shot down an unmanned US spy drone that was trying to gather information on an underground uranium enrichment site.

Dafsari said the drone was flying over the Fordo facility near the holy city of Qom in central Iran.

Iranian military official first announced in February 2005 that the United States had been flying surveillance drones over its airspace to spy on its nuclear and military facilities.]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_17448" align="alignnone" width="400" caption="Created in Paris under French sponsorship, the Syrian National Council aims to overthrow the government of President Bashar al-Assad. It is chaired by Burhan Ghalioun (left), Syrian-French political scientist and professor of sociology at Sorbonne University."]<img class="size-full wp-image-17448" title="111124095437299_34_000_apx_470_" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CNS.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="272" />[/caption]

For eight months, Western leaders and some public media have been agitating for a war in Syria. The extremely serious accusations leveled against Assad intimidate those who question the justification for a new military intervention.

But not everyone, because  some came to Syria to investigate for themselves and were able to measure the extent of NATO’s propaganda. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/108morris108" target="_blank">Morris Herman</a> interviews Thierry Meyssan from Voltaire Network, who reports on the state of the media war against Syria.

&lt;iframe width="500" height="369" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vzXvpBiTRhk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

<em><strong>Thierry Meyssan's</strong> report on on <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.voltairenet.org/Lies-and-truths-about-Syria" target="_blank">Voltaire Network</a>:</em>

In 1999, during the Kosovo war, <em>Voltaire Network</em> was outraged that France could be going to war alongside NATO without a vote from the National Assembly, with the passive complicity of the parliamentary group leaders. We considered that the refusal by the President and the Prime Minister to hold an open debate portended the opacity with which this war would be conducted. So, we took the initiative of publishing a daily bulletin on the conflict. The Serbian government websites having been immediately destroyed by the Atlantic Alliance, we had no access to the Serbian version of events. In the absence thereof, we took out subscriptions to news agencies in the region (Croatian, Bosnian, Greek, Cypriot, Turkish, Hungarian etc.).

Throughout the conflict, we presented a daily summary of NATO’s press conferences in Brussels and a summary of the reports by journalists from neighboring countries, some of which were engaged in a serious dispute with Serbia, but whose governments gave a mutually consistent account of the events. Eventually, NATO’s version and that of the local journalists drifted apart to the point of having nothing in common.

In the end, we were dealing with two radically different stories. We had no way of knowing who was lying and whether one of the two sources was telling the truth. Our readers had the impression of becoming schizophrenic, especially since the West European media were relying exclusively NATO’s version; they were, therefore, exposed to the two parallel versions only when reading our website. We continued this exercise during the three months of fighting.

When the guns fell silent and it was possible for our colleagues and friends to go on the spot, they noted with astonishment that the "<em>propaganda was not on both sides</em>." No, <strong>NATO’s version was entirely false,</strong> while that of the local journalists turned out to be entirely true.

In the months that followed, parliamentary reports were released in several Member States of the Alliance establishing the facts. In addition, several books were published on the method developed by Tony Blair’s media adviser that enabled NATO to manipulate all of the Western press: the "<em>story-telling</em>".

Indeed, it is possible to intoxicate Western journalists en masse and to hide the facts from them if they are told a children’s tale, provided the narrative is never interrupted, that it is charged with references stirring up buried emotions, and that its consistency is maintained.

I did not have the reflex to visit Serbia before the war started and I could not do so after the fighting broke out. However, dear Reader, today I am in Syria, where I took the time to investigate and from where I am writing this article. With full knowledge of the facts, I can say that NATO’s propaganda is currently operating in the same way Syria as it did in Serbia.

The Alliance began telling a story out of touch with reality, which aims to justify a "<em>humanitarian military intervention</em>," according to the oxymoron coined by Blair. The parallel ends there: Slobodan Milosevic was a war criminal who had to be portrayed as a criminal against humanity so that his country could be dismembered; Bashar al-Assad is an opponent of imperialism and Zionism, who backed Hezbollah when Lebanon was under attack and supports Hamas and the Islamic Jihad in their quest for the liberation of the Palestinian homeland.
<h3>Four NATO lies</h3>
<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /> 1. According to NATO and its Persian Gulf allies, for eight months mass demonstrations have taken place in Syria to demand more freedom and the departure of President Bashar al-Assad.

<strong>Not true</strong>. There have been demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad’s government, in some cities, at the call of Saudi and Egyptian preachers speaking on <em>Al-Jazeera</em>, but which rallied only some 100,000 people at the most. They were not claiming more freedom, but the establishment of an Islamic regime. They demanded the resignation of President al-Assad, not because of his politics, but because these protesters adhere to a sectarian strand of Sunni power, Takfirism, and they accuse Assad of being a heretic (he is Alawi) and of usurping power in a Muslim country, which they claim can only be legitimately governed by a Sunni from their theological school.

<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /> 2. According to NATO and its Persian Gulf allies, the "regime" responded by using live ammunition to disperse the crowd, leaving at least 3,500 dead since the beginning of the year.

<strong>Not true</strong>. In the first place, it is not possible to suppress demonstrations that never existed. Then, from the outset, the authorities realized that efforts were afoot to provoke sectarian strife in a country where secularism has been the mainstay of the state since the eighth century. Consequently, President Bashar al-Assad prohibited security, police and army forces from using firearms in any circumstance where civilians might get hurt. The purpose is to prevent that the injuries, or even death, of a person belonging to one creed or the other, be exploited to justify a war of religion. This prohibition is respected by the security forces at the risk of their own lives, as we shall see later. As for the dead, their number should be cut in half. The majority are not civilians, but soldiers and police, as I was able to observe during my visits to hospitals and morgues, both civilian and military.

<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /> 3. After we managed to break the wall of silence and got the big Western media to acknowledge the presence in Syria of death squads from abroad, setting up ambushes against the army and murdering civilians in the heart of the cities, NATO and its Gulf allies reported on the existence of an army of deserters. According to them, a group of military (not police) who had received the order to fire on the crowd allegedly rebelled. They apparently went underground and constituted the Free Syrian Army, already 1500 men-strong.

<strong>Not true</strong>. The deserters are only a few dozen, having fled to Turkey where they are supervised by an officer associated to the Hakim Rifaat el-Assad/Abdel Khaddam clan, famously linked to the CIA. There are, however, an increasing number of young people who refuse to do military service, more often under pressure from their families than by personal decision. Indeed, those soldiers who are caught in an ambush don’t have the right to use their firearms to defend themselves if civilians are on the scene. They have no choice but to sacrifice their lives if they are unable to escape.

<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /> 4. According to NATO and its Persian Gulf allies, the cycle of revolution/repression has paved the way for the start of a "<em>civil war</em>". 1.5 million trapped Syrians would be suffering from hunger. It is, therefore, essential to set up "<em>humanitarian corridors</em>" to deliver food aid and allow civilians to flee the combat zones.

<strong>Not true</strong>. Considering the number and the cruelty of the attacks<strong> by death squads</strong> <strong>from abroad</strong>, population displacement has been minimal. Syria is agriculturally self-sufficient and its productivity has not declined significantly. On the other hand, with most of the ambushes taking place on major roads, traffic is frequently interrupted. Moreover, when attacks spring up inside the cities, merchants shut down their shops immediately. This results in serious distribution problems, including food. The real issue lies elsewhere: economic sanctions have wrought disaster. While for the past decade Syria had registered a growth of around 5% per year, it can no longer sell its oil to Western Europe and its tourist industry has been hit hard. Many people have lost their jobs and income, having to save on everything. They are subsidized by the government, which distributes free food and heating fuel. Under such circumstances, it would be more fitting to say that if it were not for the Al-Assad government, 1.5 million Syrians would be suffering from malnutrition <strong>because of Western sanctions.</strong>

Ultimately, while we’re still in the stage of unconventional warfare, with the use of mercenaries and special forces to destabilize the country, the narrative spewed out by NATO and its Persian Gulf allies has already strayed from reality. This gap will widen more and more.

As far as you are concerned, dear Reader, there is no reason why you should believe me rather than NATO, since you are not on the spot. However, there are several elements that should send up a red flag.

[caption id="attachment_17446" align="alignnone" width="400" caption="Bernard-Henry Levy, who boasted of having embroiled France in the war on Libya to serve Israel’s interests, told &quot;Le Parisien&quot; that he has a hit list of countries."]<img class="size-full wp-image-17446" title="Sans titre" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/BHL1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="185" />[/caption]
<h3><strong>Four clues carefully hidden by NATO</strong></h3>
<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /><strong> 1.</strong> One would think that the charges concerning the alleged repression and the number of victims were carefully looked into. But not at all. They originated from a single source: the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, based in London, whose leaders demand anonymity. What is the validity of such grave accusations if they are not cross-checked and why do institutions such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights rubber stamp them without verifying their authenticity?

<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /><strong> 2.</strong> Russia and China vetoed a draft Security Council resolution meant to pave the way for an international military intervention. NATO political leaders have forlornly explained that the Russians are protecting their naval base at Tartus and that the Chinese will do anything to scrape together a few barrels of oil. Should we accept the Manichean view that Washington, London and Paris are guided by good intentions, while Moscow and Beijing are essentially selfish and insensitive to the martyrdom of the population? How to avoid noticing that Russia and China have much less of an interest in defending Syria than Westerners have in destroying it?

<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /> <strong>3.</strong> It is somewhat bizarre to observe who makes up the coalition of so-called well-intentioned states. How can it escape anyone’s notice that the two main sustainers of the Arab League and promoters of the "<em>democratization</em>" of Syria, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, are puppet dictatorships in lockstep with the United States and the United Kingdom? Should not one wonder how credible the West can be - after having successively ravaged Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya and killing more than 1. 2 million people in ten years, thus showing how little value they attach to human life - when it waves a humanitarian banner?

<img src="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L9xH11/puce-cebf5.gif" alt="-" width="9" height="11" /> <strong>4.</strong> To avoid being manipulated on the events unfolding in Syria, the best thing is to put them in context. For NATO and its Persian Gulf allies, whose armies invaded Yemen and Bahrain to savagely quell peaceful demonstrations, the "<em>Syrian Revolution</em>" is an extension of the "<em>Arab spring</em>", perceived by them as peoples in the region who dream of a market democracy and the comfort of the <em>American Way of Life</em>. On their part, the Russians and Chinese, apace with the Venezuelans and the South Africans, recognize the events in Syria as the continuation of <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://mondediplo.com/2004/04/04world">Washington’s plan "<em>to remodel the Greater Middle East</em></a>", which has already claimed 1.2 million lives and which anyone truly concerned about protecting human lives must strive to put an end to. They haven’t forgotten that on 15 September 2001, <strong>President George W. Bush green-lighted a plan to wage seven wars.</strong>

Preparations for the attack on Syria formally began on 12 December 2003 with the adoption of the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-512es.html"><strong><em>Syrian Accountability Act</em></strong></a> in the wake of the fall of Baghdad. Since that day, the President of the United States - today Barack Obama - is under an order from Congress to attack Syria and is dispensed from any further clearance before launching hostilities. Therefore, the question is not whether NATO has found a divine justification for going to war, but whether Syria will find a way out of this situation, in the same way she outmaneuvered all the previous pitfalls and defamatory accusations leveled against her, such as the assassination of Rafik Hariri and the Israeli raid against an imaginary nuclear military plant.
<h3><strong>Western mainstream media testify</strong></h3>
At the end of this article, I would like to underscore that <em>Voltaire Network</em> facilitated a press visit to Syria, organized at the initiative of the Catholic Information Center of Middle East Christians, as part of the opening towards Western media announced by President al-Assad at the Arab League. We assisted mainstream journalists to travel to combat zones. At first, our colleagues were wary of our presence, both because they had negative preconceived ideas about us and because they thought we were trying to brainwash them. They eventually came to realize that we are normal people and that the fact of having chosen our camp did not mean we had renounced our critical spirit. In the end, though still convinced of NATO’s benevolence and while failing to share our commitment to anti-imperialism, they opened their eyes and ears to the truth.

Currently, their reports honestly reflect the actions perpetrated by the armed gangs that are terrorizing the country. Of course, they have refrained from openly contradicting the NATO version and tried to reconcile it with what they saw and heard, which called for some awkward contortions around the concept of a ’<em>civil war</em>’ allegedly pitting the Syrian army against foreign mercenaries. Nevertheless, reports by <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.rtbf.be/"><em>Télévision Belge</em></a> (RTBF) and <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.lalibre.be/"><em>La Libre Belgique</em></a>, to name a few, now clearly reveal that for eight months NATO has masked the actions of death squads and falsely attributed their crimes to the Syrian authorities.]]></content:encoded>

Russia will not allow the repetition of the Libyan scenario in Syria, Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, has said after a meeting with the Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf in Abu-Dhabi.

­“We do not support regimes, we support international law,” Lavrov reiterated Moscow’s stance on Syria. Russia insists on mediating dialogue between the authorities and opposition in the country and this position is reflected in the draft resolution of Russia and China.

He said that Russia supports a peaceful initiative of the Arab League. The document, which was made public on Monday in Doha, provides for withdrawal of tank units from Syrian cities and the start of talks between the forces involved in the conflict.

According to Lavrov, this initiative is the only possible way to make sure that Syrians will “decide their future for themselves through national dialogue and civil reconciliation.”

“We advocate an approach which, among others, is applied in Yemen,” the Russian Foreign Minister explained. “There was an initiative of the Co-operation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf. And everyone, be it the Council itself, the Arab League, the EU, US, Russia or China, acted responsibly, without setting artificial deadlines, waiting for months until the goal was achieved.”

Lavrov believes that the Security Council resolution on Yemen should be a used as a model for the future. This is something that goes against the stance of some “esteemed NATO member states” who say the Libyan operation should be viewed as a role model.

“Isolation is not our approach,” Lavrov outlined. “If something goes wrong in Syria, many countries of the region will feel a negative impact. We can’t support isolation because of the lesson we drew from Libya.”

The lesson was that arms supplies to Libya continued despite the embargo introduced by the Security Council, “and some heads of states openly admitted the fact”, which only contributed to the escalation of tensions.

Lavrov also criticized the US decision to stop financing UNESCO because of granting membership to Palestine. The Russian Foreign Minister said Moscow hopes that Washington will review its decision.

“We believe that accepting Palestine to UNESCO was a justified demand. The voting was legal,” Lavrov said. He called the US decision “regrettable” adding that “it is not something that will help restore good climate necessary for resuming negotiations.

Moscow is convinced that Palestinian authorities do not consider UNESCO or UN membership as an alternative to talks with Israel, the Minister outlined.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>US Judge rejects out-of-court settlement between Citigroup and Wall Street regulators</title>

[caption id="attachment_17465" align="alignnone" width="320" caption="The case involves the sale of toxic mortgages which meant losses of $700million for investors."]<img class="size-full wp-image-17465" title="casaembargada" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/casaembargada.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="240" />[/caption]

<em>A US judge rejected this week a 285m dollars settlement between Citigroup and Wall Street's regulator, the SEC, over the sale of toxic mortgages.</em>

Federal court judge Jed Rakoff ordered a trial, saying the settlement was “neither reasonable, nor fair, nor adequate, nor in the public interest”.

The SEC claimed Citigroup sold 1bn worth of mortgage assets and then bet that their value would fall. In a written opinion, the Manhattan judge said the allegations against Citigroup should go to trial.

Under the settlement, agreed in October, Citigroup was to pay $285mi8llion to compensate investors for losses on the mortgage assets, which plunged in value months after the bank sold them in 2007.

Investors lost $700 million, according to the SEC, while Citigroup made about 160 million dollars in profits.

The trial would seek to establish clarity about the financial markets and the Security and Exchange Commission's responsibility to uncover the truth, the judge said.

“Although this [settlement] would appear to be tantamount to an allegation of knowing and fraudulent intent... the SEC, for reasons of its own, chose to charge Citigroup only with negligence,” Judge Rakoff said.

He said that the settlement, in which Citigroup did not admit or deny the accusations, did not give him enough information to know whether the deal was fair or correct.

“The court concludes, regretfully, that the proposed Consent Judgment is neither fair, nor reasonable, nor adequate, nor in the public interest,” the judge said.]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_17471" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="The case was dramatized in the award-winning film &#39;Missing&#39;."]<img class="size-large wp-image-17471" title="missing" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/missing-500x277.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="277" />[/caption]

<strong>By Joe Hinchliffe</strong>

<em>Chile’s Supreme Court has requested the extradition of former US army officer, Capt. Raymond E. Davis, over his alleged involvement in the murder of two US citizens in Chile, days after the coup of 11 September, 1973 that ushered in 17 years of brutal military rule.</em>

Judge Jorge Zepeda issued the indictment request as part of a long-running trial into the deaths of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi, triggered by a criminal suit filed in 2000 by the widow of one of the victims, Joyce Horman.

Capt. Davis, who was commander of the US Military Group in Chile, is accused of providing Chilean military intelligence agents with information that led to the arrest, torture and subsequent death in custody of the journalists.

The trial has already made significant advances in its attempt to establish the chain of command that led to the arrest of former Chilean military officers accused of tracking the journalists in the last days of their lives.

The case was given high international profile following the 1982 release of the award winning film “Missing,” which promotes the allegations of Joyce Horman that her husband was murdered because he was unwittingly made aware of CIA involvement in the military coup.

The victims were both involved in the American Information Source (FIN), a left-wing organization which supported socialist President Salvador Allende in the years leading up to the coup.

Horman is believed to have made contact with Captain Davis in a hotel in the port city of Viña del Mar and was later driven by the former naval officer to Santiago, days before his detention. Both bodies were later discovered in the streets of the capital, riddled with bullets and showing signs of torture.

In 2001 the Chilean government issued a request to hear the testimony of former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, over the role of US intelligence services in the case.

The US government has officially and repeatedly denied any involvement in the coup, although US Government documents, declassified by the Clinton administration in 1999, declare that “U.S. intelligence may have played an unfortunate part in Horman's death”.

Judge Zepeda’s ruling drew heavily on evidence procured from the heavily redacted documents, which describe Capt. Davis as “being in a position. . . [to] prevent the murder” of the journalists, given his “coordination with Chilean agents.”

The US Embassy in Santiago released a statement stating that it does not comment on specific cases. “The US Government continues to support a thorough investigation into the Horman and Teruggi deaths in order to bring those responsible to justice,” the statement said.

Capt. Davis has denied his involvement in the murders. His whereabouts are currently unknown.]]></content:encoded>

Thanks for the tips, but I have tried all this before and for some bedevil-ed reason it just doesn't work on my computer!
I left-click on the image and then I see a bigger one (usually), but when I right-click on it, for some reason there's no 'Save as' Option!
What I see on the Menu are the following:

Back
Forward 
Reload
Bookmark this Page
Save  Page As
Send Link
View Background Image (this turns out blank)
Select All
View Page Source
View Page Info

So for some reason it's linking with the article rather than the picture, see?!
Really annoying! Grrrrrr.......
I sure wish I knew what to do about it but I'm stumped.
Maybe I'll go and ask Fred at the Forum. :)

When the mouse arrow is on the picture and I right-click, I get:

Copy image location

I never get the 'image' menu even when the arrow IS on the Picture.  Has to be a software problem - maybe I need a Registry Cleaner or something.
Screenshots aren't working either:  when I try to use the Snipping Tool by circling the area I want using the cursor, the whole picture just moves as though I'm dragging it.  Grrrrrr.......
But thanks anyway for trying to help! :)
I'll see if Fred or my technician can help.

Another option is: first left-click so that the bigger image appears, then press CTRL together with the letter 's' (from 'save', and 'together' like at the same moment ;) well actually press CTRL, keep it pressed, then also press the letter s), then hopefully it automatically opens a window where you can save the image.]]></wp:comment_content>

Photos with a message of "peace" and "reconciliation"... a cheap ploy to sell expensive Benetton crap at the expense of the oppressed and with excrement smelling pretenses of search for justice, love against hate, LOVEHATE... UNHATE...

Now, you spineless Benetton, had you had the balls, and wanting to promote UNHATE, be provocative AND sell your crap, you would have created something like this:

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17496" title="monsanto" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/monsanto-500x444.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="444" />
<em>Even Nicolas Sarkozy, the current president of France, voiced his opposition to Monsanto's GMO maize.</em>

<strong>By Anthony Gucciardi</strong>

France is the latest nation to voice opposition against <a title="genetically modified" href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://naturalsociety.com/genetically-modified-foods/" target="_blank">genetically modified</a> crops, with GM maize unlikely to hit French fields next year, despite the end of a ban on Monsanto maize.

The news comes as evidence compiles that French legislatures will launch new restrictions regarding the use of Monsanto’s 810 maize on French soil.

It all began when France’s State Council <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/28/us-france-gmo-idUSTRE7AR19H20111128" target="_blank">overturned the ban</a> on Monsanto’s <a title="GMO" href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://naturalsociety.com/genetically-modified-foods/" target="_blank">GMO</a> maize stating that it was not sufficiently justified.

The organization then attempted to justify its decision by saying that the government did not give enough evidence to justify a ban.

Under law, an EU country can only unilaterally ban a genetically modified strain if it can scientifically prove it is a risk to the health of humans, animals, or the integrity of the environment.

Interestingly, the ban was lifted under these circumstances after numerous reports have surfaced highlighting the many ways in which <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://naturalsociety.com/how-biotech-corporations-and-gmo-crops-are-threatening-the-environment-and-humankind-alike/" target="_blank">GMO crops and biopesticides are thoroughly damaging</a> the environment.

This is why <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://naturalsociety.com/how-biotech-corporations-and-gmo-crops-are-threatening-the-environment-and-humankind-alike/" target="_blank">GMO crops are continually being banned</a> around the world in a display of defiance against biotech giant, Monsanto.

Nations like <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://naturalsociety.com/hungary-destroys-all-monsanto-gmo-corn-fields/" target="_blank">Hungary have taken a stand against GMO crops</a> and Monsanto, destroying 1000 acres of maize found to have been grown with genetically modified seeds. Many of the farmers were actually shocked to find they were using GMO seeds, which are resulting in <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.google.com/url?q=http://naturalsociety.com/how-biotech-corporations-and-gmo-crops-are-threatening-the-environment-and-humankind-alike/&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=sbHSTuuuF9PptgeavuSGDA&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAI&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYKwEP4x_9_DuNlmwb9qd6usL-Kw" target="_blank">extreme environmental consequence</a>.

Peru has also taken a stand for health freedom, passing a monumental <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.google.com/url?q=http://naturalsociety.com/how-biotech-corporations-and-gmo-crops-are-threatening-the-environment-and-humankind-alike/&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=sbHSTuuuF9PptgeavuSGDA&amp;ved=0CBQQFjAI&amp;client=internal-uds-cse&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYKwEP4x_9_DuNlmwb9qd6usL-Kw" target="_blank">10 year ban on genetically modified foods</a>. Amazingly, Peru’s Plenary Session of the Congress made the decision despite previous governmental pushes for GM legalization. The known and unknown dangers of GMO crops seem to supersede even executive-level governmental directives.

Even Nicolas Sarkozy, the current president of the French Republic, voiced his opposition to Monsanto’s GMO maize:
<blockquote>The French government keeps and will keep its opposition against the cultivation of the Monsanto 810 maize on our soil, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/29/us-france-gmo-idUSTRE7AS1VT20111129" target="_blank">Sarkozy said</a>.</blockquote>
Nations and individuals around the world are ready to drive Monsanto out, and bring sustainable and health-promoting organic farming into their daily lives. Fresh produce is the future, free of GMOs and full of vital nutrients.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17531" title="said-ramadan" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/said-ramadan-500x217.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="217" />
<em>Les services secrets américains ont longtemps soutenu la confrérie, née en 1928 en Égypte.</em>

Le fonds E 4320, conservé aux archives fédérales à Berne, concerne Saïd Ramadan, le gendre d'Hassan el-Banna, fondateur des Frères musulmans égyptiens. Poursuivi par le régime nassérien, réfugié en Suisse en 1959, Saïd Ramadan a créé le Centre islamique de Genève, le premier institut de ce genre en Europe. Il est par ailleurs l'un des fondateurs de la Ligue islamique mondiale inspirée par les Saoudiens. <a href="http://www.lepoint2.com/sons/pdf/freres-musulmans-1.jpg" target="_blank">Une note confidentielle des services secrets suisses datant du 17 août 1966</a> évoque la "sympathie" de la BUPO, la police fédérale sur la protection de l'État, pour Saïd Ramadan. Elle ajoute : "Il est en excellents termes avec les Anglais et les Américains."

Un autre document, daté du 5 juillet 1967, se montre encore plus précis. Saïd Ramadan est présenté comme un "agent d'information des Anglais et des Américains. De plus, il a rendu des services - sur le plan d'informations - à la BUPO." Toujours est-il qu'<a href="http://www.lepoint2.com/sons/pdf/freres-musulmans-2.jpg" target="_blank">une réunion, présidée par le chef du service du Ministère public fédéral, du 3 juillet 1967</a>, décide d'accorder un permis de séjour à Saïd Ramadan, alors que ce dernier aurait dû être expulsé le 31 janvier 1967. Les raisons de cette tolérance ? La possibilité "que les amis de Saïd Ramadan prennent le pouvoir dans les mois à venir dans l'un ou l'autre État aujourd'hui qualifié de progressiste ou socialiste".

<strong>Saïd Ramadan et le président américain </strong>

Ces documents déclassés vont dans le même sens que l'ouvrage publié en septembre dernier par le journaliste américain Ian Johnson, lauréat du prix Pulitzer, <em>Une mosquée à Munich. </em><em>Les nazis, la CIA et la montée des Frères musulmans en Occident</em> (*), on découvre que les Allemands, pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, ont utilisé les Tchétchènes, les Kazakhs, les Ouzbeks, les musulmans vivant en URSS contre les communistes athées. Les Américains ont ensuite pris le relais, soutenant les islamistes contre le bloc communiste et ses satellites. En juillet 1953, une délégation de musulmans est invitée aux États-Unis, et reçue à la Maison-Blanche, parmi eux Saïd Ramadan.

Le 28 octobre dernier, dans un article intitulé "Le rôle mobilisateur de Saïd Ramadan", le site francophone Oumma.com montre la photo du président Dwight Eisenhower entouré des membres de la délégation. Saïd Ramadan est à sa droite. Le président américain estime que, dans ses relations avec les dirigeants arabes, "notre foi en Dieu devrait nous donner un objectif commun : la lutte contre le communisme et son athéisme", relève Ian Johnson. Quelques années plus tard, Saïd Ramadan, réfugié en Europe, traite avec Bob Dreher, un agent de la CIA installé à Munich.

<strong>Une thèse sur la charia </strong>

Saïd Ramadan vient d'obtenir en 1959 un doctorat en droit de l'université de Cologne pour sa thèse <em>La charia, le droit islamique, son envergure et son équité</em>. Il brûle d'envie d'étendre son influence à l'Europe entière. "Installé à Genève, il considérait Munich, à une journée de route de son domicile, comme l'endroit idéal où établir une sorte de base avancée", lit-on dans <em>Une mosquée à Munich</em>. La CIA finançait directement Saïd Ramadan et les Frères musulmans en Europe.

Ian Johnson reste prudent, dans la mesure où une partie des archives de l'agence de renseignements ne peut être consultée. "Tout indique que Dreher et l'Amcomlib eurent recours aux moyens financiers et politiques à leur disposition pour donner un coup de pouce au principal représentant des Frères musulmans en Europe", écrit-il. L'Amcomlib, ou American Committee for Liberation from Bolshevism, était un faux nez des services américains.

<strong>Il roulait en Cadillac</strong>

René Naba, ancien responsable du monde arabo-musulman au service diplomatique de l'AFP, penche davantage pour une sous-traitance par la Jordanie et l'Arabie saoudite. Pour preuve, Saïd Ramadan, de nationalité égyptienne, voyageait à cette époque avec un passeport diplomatique jordanien. Apparemment, le gendre d'Hassan el-Banna ne manquait pas de subsides, <em>Une mosquée à Munich</em> raconte ainsi qu'il roulait en Cadillac...

Décédé en 1995 à Genève, Saïd Ramadan est notamment le père de l'islamologue Tariq Ramadan, et de Hani Ramadan, qui lui a succédé à la tête du Centre islamique de Genève.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17520" title="aisha349" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/aisha349.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="356" />
<em>Le dichiarazioni dei media attribuite a Aisha Al-Ghedaffi fanno parte di un complotto NATO-Sionista per farla espellere dall'Algeria, catturarla o assassinarla.</em>

Dopo aver dichiarato il "successo" di Stati Uniti ed Europa nell'operazione militare della NATO, portando la vittoria al regime del TNC per togliere la democrazia al popolo libico (di Jamahiriya) e prepararsi per l'invasione della Siria, l'obiettivo dei media globali è ora quello di occultare il ruolo della NATO nella demolizione della Libia.

Va ricordato che la guerra alla Libia è stata resa possibile in gran parte a causa di una copertura data da false notizie dei media, in un "riciclaggio di informazione", esercizio che vedeva l'intelligence degli Stati Uniti e dell'opposizione libica in esilio diffondere false notizie via Twitter e telefonate anonime, che sarebbero poi state riportate da media arabi del Golfo ostili a Gheddafi, che a loro volta sarebbero state riportate dai piu' "credibili" media occidentali come la BBC, CNN e Reuters, che citavano i media arabi, e le fonti originali (in forma anonima o falso account Twitter o telefonate). In questo modo le menzogne ​​divennero riciclate come fatti veri, per spianare la strada al Consiglio di sicurezza dell'ONU e ad altre decisioni politiche e militari per dare il via libera per distruggere uno dei più avanzati sistemi socio-economici del mondo e le sue conquiste, che la NATO vedeva diventare una minaccia per l'egemonia in Africa da parte dei banchieri occidentali '.

La copertura e la distorsione delle notizie sulle azioni dell'esercito libico e dei volontari "verdi" dellaresistenza, sulle azioni per la liberazione della Libia dagli invasori, è stata progettata per consolidare la situazione, cercando di confondere e demoralizzare la resistenza. La presenza di squadre operative della Nato in Libia ha anche impedito di ricevere alcuna menzione da parte dei media riguardo agli orribili crimini commessi dalla NATO e dai loro mercenari al suolo, affinchè queste atrocità dai propri cellulari fossero scaricate su YouTube. Hanno così continuano a terrorizzare i civili impunemente, creato campi di morte per coloro che non supportano il regime del "TNC" loro imposto, affinchè la grande maggioranza della popolazione libica non avesse più una voce. Un altro degli obiettivi è la famiglia Gheddafi, ed in questi giorni particolarmente quelli residenti rifugiati in Algeria (più in basso sono riportate maggiori notizie in merito).

Inoltre, uno degli obiettivi principali del MSM globale dei media è quello di creare un clima di confusione circa la resistenza libica, su ogni fronte e tra le persone di buona volontà che cercano di lottare contro gli occupanti e la loro propaganda. Per raggiungere questo obiettivo i media fanno uso gratuito di video falsi, foto e reports sulla cattura di leaders libici famosi, sia in Libia che nel mondo. Un primo esempio di ciò è il presunto omicidio del colonnello Muammar Gheddafi, che possiamo nuovamente confermare sia in un posto sicuro ed in buona salute, e anche varie dichiarazioni che vengono attribuite alla famiglia Gheddafi ed alla resistenza. Lo scopo è quello di far credere che la resistenza sia debole e che non possa proteggere i suoi dirigenti, per creare l'impressione che ogni persona che sia dichiarata leader della resistenza sarà immediatamente tradita e catturata dalla NATO o dai suoi fantocci del TNC.

Un altro obiettivo nella diffusione di notizie false (in quanto le comunicazioni sono state in gran parte interrotte tra la Jamahiriya libica e la famiglia Gheddafi e il movimento libico verde, dal momento del tradimento e dell'invasione di Tripoli il 21 agosto, e della distruzione delle città libiche che avevano rifiutato di accettare il regime di dittatura imposto dallo straniero), è di avviare la discussione tra la comunità mondiale, semplicemente per opporsi all'aggressione della NATO, invece di accusare media e NATO per i crimini commessi contro l'umanità e per cercare di portare in evidenza le prove ben documentate di tutti questi crimini che loro hanno commesso .

Inoltre, i media globali possono propagare bugie attraverso media degli accondiscendenti piccoli stati arabi, che sono stati facilmente sotto il loro controllo tramite redattori incaricati alla disinformazione. Dopo di ciò, tutte le "notizie" hanno avuto acriticamente eco attraverso tutti i media del mondo. E' purtroppo frequente che la gente cominci a fidarsi di queste bugie enormi provenienti da ogni sorgente multimediale, che i consumatori di notizie non si rendono conto come vengano emanate da un'unica fonte, non decine come appare loro, per via che quasi mai queste reti attribuiscono la fonte originale corretta.

Molte persone sono ingenue e pensano che se qualcosa è scritto in diversi media sia dunque vero. Non si rendono conto che questo "schema" è stato realizzato durante la "guerra fredda", con grande successo nella propaganda per spacciare i media occidentali capitalisti come "liberi" e "democratici", nonostante la compromettente concentrazione delle proprietà come parte dell'unione del capitalismo globale e del "nuovo ordine mondiale" per consolidare il controllo delle corporazioni globali. Né si rendono conto che il movimento mondiale per la Jamahiriya ha ancora una fonte indipendente di notizie e informazioni, che ha finora resistito alla censura per pura abilità tecnica e determinazione senza compromessi.

<strong>Nuovi complotti contro Aisha Gheddafi</strong>

Aver tramato per dare l'illusione che la parte principale della famiglia Gheddafi ed il legittimo governo della Libia (sistema di democrazia diretta della Jamahiriya) siano morti o catturati, insieme al piano dei media globali e della NATO per un attacco imminente a coloro che continuano a resistere, sono parte del proggetto di diffusione di video e foto di Aisha Gheddafi la quale starebbe presumibilmente per essere espulsa dall'Algeria e catturata. Per raggiungere questo obiettivo, i falsi video ed i falsi rapporti su Aisha, i quali affermano che i membri vivi della famiglia Gheddafi sono morti, sono stati diffusi attraverso la rete globale da parte della NATO, ed assimilati interamente dai media e dalle reti straniere di diffusione di notizie, comprese quelle che sostengono di essere dalla parte della resistenza. Questo complotto è un palese tentativo di voler catturare Aisha Gheddafi, che è vista da molti come il vero erede alla leadership rivoluzionaria di Muammar Gheddafi, per farla espellere dall'Algeria.

Il fatto è che fonti molto affidabili di Mathaba, rivelano che Aisha non ha fatto discorsi, né comunicati ad alcun mezzo di stampa. Inoltre, era stata messa a tacere dalle autorità algerine, che, come condizione per la permanenza in Algeria, le avevano dichiaratamente proibito di parlare con i media, subito dopo il suo arrivo con due dei suoi fratelli, sua madre, e gli altri amici di famiglia. Ella è quindi in grado di difendersi contro i falsi messaggi che le vengono attribuiti, che rivendicano la morte di suo padre, due dei suoi fratelli e la cattura di un terzo.

Mathaba conferma che lei non ha fatto alcuna dichiarazione, come è stato trasmesso dalla tv Al-Rai, non solo perché ne saremmo stati informati, come al solito, ma anche perché i suoi contenuti sono palesemente falsi. Pertanto le autorità algerine, se desiderano in futuro l'aiuto da parte di tutte le persone di buona volontà del mondo quando verrà il loro turno di essere gli obiettivi della NATO, come pure per il rispetto di base dei principi umanitari e legali, non deve espellere Aisha e non deve permettere che "tali false affermazioni dei media" siano rivendicate come sue.

Messaggi attribuiti al Ministero algerino degli Affari Esteri, che sono oggi in circolazione, affermando che Aisha abbia violato le sue "condizioni per restare in Algeria", preparando così la strada alla sua deportazione. Dati i racconti delle organizzazioni internazionali per i diritti umani, sulla sanguinosa distruzione della Libia e l'uccisione di circa oltre 100 mila libici, chiunque ponga Aisha da qualche parte vicino al confine della Libia darebbe un movente per il suo omicidio, in violazione di tutti i diritti umani e le norme di giustizia.

Altre fonti attendibili indicano che nel corso dei prossimi due giorni e probabilmente già oggi, Domenica 4 dicembre, al mattino (ora di New York) o alla sera (ora europea / Africa) vi giungerà la "notizia" riguardo ad Aisha Gheddafi arrestata vicino al confine tra la Libia e l'Algeria. Foto e video sono già pronti per mostrare Aisha agli arresti, e, in base alle fonti, sono stati preparati in anticipo. Il rilascio di questi falsi video e false immagini, sono stati facilmente forgiati nell'odierno mondo digitale, di fatto basato sull'industria cinematografica di Hollywood per scopi di intrattenimento, ma molti non si rendono ora conto che tale tecnologia sia stata anche in gran parte usata per costruire la cronaca libica degli ultimi 10 mesi, costringendo molti a concludere che la resistenza non esiste perché non ha potuto proteggere la figlia di Gheddafi e forse anche al fine di compromettere l'Algeria, così come per rendere disperati i libici in generale e far sentire delusi molti dei loro sostenitori in giro per il mondo.

Muammar Gheddafi aveva già avvertito i suoi sostenitori di essere pronti a quelle bugie e di non arrestare la lotta contro la NATO. La guerriglia e la guerra dell'informazione contro la NATO, che controlla i cieli libici, i media e le reti di comunicazione, deve essere diffusa in rete senza quartieri generali dichiarati, in quanto i quartieri generali possono essere eliminati dalle forze militari. Molti di coloro che sostengono la Libia non si rendono conto che ogni azione deve essere ben preparata e che ci vuole tempo, con i mezzi di informazione sotto assedio, e soprattutto dalla fine di agosto molte persone pensano che la resistenza in Libia non esista più. Non si possono valutare credibilmente i rapporti che provengono dalle tribù le quali in precedenza avevano sostenuto il TNC e che ora voltano le armi contro di esso.

Per dissolvere la fede nella Resistenza, sia tra libici che tra i loro sostenitori, che insieme ad essi si battono contro i Nato-media-globali, nei prossimi giorni il complotto sull'arresto di Aisha potrà essere diffuso attraverso i consueti canali mediatici e ritrasmesso da blogger ignari e social-media di attivisti. Non fidatevi di tutti coloro che hanno mentito fin dall'inizio e che continueranno a farlo: la guerra mediatica contro i popoli del mondo e la gente della Libia è in corso.

==================================
LE DICHIARAZIONI DEI MEDIA ATTRIBUITE A AISHA AL-GHEDDAFI FANNO PARTE DI UN COMPLOTTO NATO-SIONISTA PER FARLA ESPELLERE DALL'ALGERIA, CATTURARLA O ASSASSINARLA.

Dopo aver dichiarato il "successo" di Stati Uniti ed Europa nell'operazione militare della NATO, portando la vittoria al regime del TNC per togliere la democrazia al popolo libico (di Jamahiriya) e prepararsi per l'invasione della Siria, l'obiettivo dei media globali è ora quello di occultare il ruolo della NATO nella demolizione della Libia.

Inoltre, era stata messa a tacere dalle autorità algerine, che, come condizione per la permanenza in Algeria, le avevano dichiaratamente proibito di parlare con i media, subito dopo il suo arrivo con due dei suoi fratelli, sua madre, e gli altri amici di famiglia. Ella è quindi in grado di difendersi contro i falsi messaggi che le vengono attribuiti, che rivendicano la morte di suo padre, due dei suoi fratelli e la cattura di un terzo.

Mathaba conferma che lei non ha fatto alcuna dichiarazione, come è stato trasmesso dalla tv Al-Rai, non solo perché ne saremmo stati informati, come al solito, ma anche perché i suoi contenuti sono palesemente falsi. Pertanto le autorità algerine, se desiderano in futuro l'aiuto da parte di tutte le persone di buona volontà del mondo quando verrà il loro turno di essere gli obiettivi della NATO, come pure per il rispetto di base dei principi umanitari e legali, non deve espellere Aisha e non deve permettere che "tali false affermazioni dei media" siano rivendicate come sue.

Messaggi attribuiti al Ministero algerino degli Affari Esteri, che sono oggi in circolazione, affermando che Aisha abbia violato le sue "condizioni per restare in Algeria", preparando così la strada alla sua deportazione. Dati i racconti delle organizzazioni internazionali per i diritti umani, sulla sanguinosa distruzione della Libia e l'uccisione di circa oltre 100 mila libici, chiunque ponga  Aisha da qualche parte vicino al confine della Libia darebbe un movente per il suo omicidio, in violazione di tutti i diritti umani e le norme di giustizia.

Altre fonti attendibili indicano che nel corso dei prossimi due giorni e probabilmente già oggi, Domenica 4 dicembre, al mattino (ora di New York) o alla sera (ora europea / Africa) vi giungerà la "notizia" riguardo ad Aisha Gheddafi arrestata vicino al confine tra la Libia e l'Algeria. Foto e video sono già pronti per mostrare Aisha agli arresti, e, in base alle fonti, sono stati preparati in anticipo. Il rilascio di questi falsi video e false immagini, sono stati facilmente forgiati nell'odierno mondo digitale, di fatto basato sull'industria cinematografica di Hollywood per scopi di intrattenimento, ma molti non si rendono ora conto che tale tecnologia sia stata anche in gran parte usata per costruire la cronaca libica degli ultimi 10 mesi, costringendo molti a concludere che la resistenza non esiste perché non ha potuto proteggere la figlia di Gheddafi e forse anche al fine di compromettere l'Algeria, così come per rendere disperati i libici in generale e far sentire delusi molti dei loro sostenitori in giro per il mondo.

Muammar Gheddafi aveva già avvertito i suoi sostenitori di essere pronti a quelle bugie e di non arrestare la lotta contro la NATO. La guerriglia e la guerra dell'informazione contro la NATO, che controlla i cieli libici, i media e le reti di comunicazione, deve essere diffusa in rete senza quartieri generali dichiarati, in quanto i quartieri generali possono essere eliminati dalle forze militari. Molti di coloro che sostengono la Libia non si rendono conto che ogni azione deve essere ben preparata e che ci vuole tempo, con i mezzi di informazione sotto assedio, e soprattutto dalla fine di agosto molte persone pensano che la resistenza in Libia non esista più. Non si possono valutare credibilmente i rapporti che provengono dalle tribù le quali in precedenza avevano sostenuto il TNC e che ora voltano le armi contro di esso.

Per dissolvere la fede nella Resistenza, sia tra libici che tra i loro sostenitori, che insieme ad essi si battono contro i Nato-media-globali, nei prossimi giorni il complotto sull'arresto di Aisha potrà essere diffuso attraverso i consueti canali mediatici e ritrasmesso da blogger ignari e social-media di attivisti. Non fidatevi di tutti coloro che hanno mentito fin dall'inizio e che continueranno a farlo: la guerra mediatica contro i popoli  del mondo e la gente della Libia è in corso.

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/nit2am/" target="_blank">Martin Iqbal</a></strong>

<strong>Israel's plan to eviscerate the Arab and Muslim states, eyes nuclear Pakistan as the final hurdle. In the wake of NATO’s deadly November 26 attack on Pakistan, the S.I.T.E. Intelligence Group rears its head to carry forward the Zionist deceptions.</strong>

In February 1982 an important Hebrew paper appeared in a Jewish journal named <em>KIVUNIM</em> (<em>Directions</em>). Penned by Oded Yinon and titled ‘<em>A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties</em>‘, the essay delineates strategies for Israel to become a regional hegemon in the Middle East. The short and long term strategies discussed involve the dissolution of the surrounding Arab states, and the expansion of Israel beyond its current (undeclared) borders. Over a decade later in 1996, a Zionist study group led by arch Jewish Zionist Richard Perle wrote a paper entitled ‘<em>A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm</em>‘. ‘<em>A Clean Break</em>‘ was largely a rehashing of Oded Yinon’s essay, adapting the same strategies to the contemporary geopolitical landscape of the Middle East.

The Mossad false flag attacks of September 11, 2011 ushered in the Zionist-designed ‘War on Terror’. Before the attacks had even concluded, before any conclusive proof of the perpetrators could possibly have been attained, <a href="http://empirestrikesblack.com/2011/09/september-11-2001-zionist-shock-therapy-and-the-birth-of-the-lie/" target="_blank">a prominent architect of the attacks appeared</a><sup>(1)</sup> on BBC World in order to name the states that had to be dissolved under Israel’s grand strategy (including Iraq, Libya, Syria and Iran). The U.S. Military was to be used as a mere tool, a ‘host body’ that would act as the American glove protecting the Israeli hand from the blood and treasure that would be spilled and spent. Since that time the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East and Central Asia has changed radically; we have seen the ‘Clean Break’ strategy unfold. In 2011 alone, Israel’s plan has lurched forward to engulf Libya and Syria. A major conflagration looms in the Middle East as Bashar Al-Assad faces a concerted destabilisation attempt mounted by Israel, the U.S, Jordan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.

Oded Yinon’s plan is centred around the exploitation of ethnic, religious and tribal divisions within the Arab world. He notes that the Arab states have been largely defined by Britain and France, with arbitrary borders drawn that are not faithful to the ethnic, religious, and tribal differences between the different peoples in the region. Likening the Arab world to a house of cards, Yinon surmises that the entire region can be easily broken up into tiny states based on ethnic, religious, or tribal lines. This would preclude any centralised governance, and ensure that power is only localised to these ‘mini-states’. In effecting this strategy, Israel would remove any real opposition to its regional dominance.

<strong>Egypt, Libya &amp; Sudan</strong>

‘<em>A Strategy for Israel in the Nineteen Eighties</em>‘ makes clear Israel’s goal of balkanising (or ‘breaking up into smaller states’) Egypt and the surround states of Libya and Sudan:
<blockquote>Egypt, in its present domestic political picture, is already a corpse, all the more so if we take into account the growing Moslem-Christian rift. <strong>Breaking Egypt down territorially into distinct geographical regions is the political aim of Israel in the Nineteen Eighties on its Western front.</strong>

<em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Egypt is divided and torn apart into many foci of authority. If Egypt falls apart, countries like Libya, Sudan or even the more distant states will not continue to exist in their present form and will join the downfall and dissolution of Egypt.</strong> The vision of a Christian Coptic State in Upper Egypt alongside a number of weak states with very localized power and without a centralized government as to date, is the key to a historical development which was only set back by the peace agreement but which seems inevitable in the long run.</blockquote>
The illegal war on Libya has already plunged the country into tribal conflict and chaos, signalling a new phase in Israel’s plan. Sudan, as we have seen very recently, has already been split into two distinct states: Sudan and South Sudan. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.middleeastmonitor.org.uk/articles/middle-east/1955-israelis-can-tell-the-whole-story-of-sudans-division-they-wrote-the-script-and-trained-the-actors" target="_blank">In a piece</a><sup>(2)</sup> published by the Al-Khaleej Times, Fahmi Howeidi expertly lays out how Israel has brought about the balkanisation of Sudan by training and cultivating secessionist groups, and provoking internal wars since the nineteen fifties. As Howeidi succinctly writes, "<em>the crop sown by Israel and its allies since the 1950s is beginning to bear fruit</em>".

Pertaining to Libya, Islamic scholar Sheikh Imran Hosein’s analysis is right on point. He theorises that the Libya war, waged by NATO, an extension of the Zionist entity, is a precursor to the balkanisation of Egypt. Hosein envisages a two-pronged attack on Egypt: NATO and its proxy land forces from the west, and Israel from the east.

&lt;iframe width="500" height="369" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3MR_m9L7pLE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Moving to Egypt’s eastern frontier, it is a well known fact that Israel covets the Sinai (the Egyptian peninsula east of the Nile River) for not only ideological reasons (the realisation of Greater Israel), but also economic ones. Yinon makes no secret of Israeli designs on the Sinai:
<blockquote><strong>The loss of the Suez Canal oil fields, of the immense potential of the oil, gas and other natural resources in the Sinai peninsula which is geomorphologically identical to the rich oil-producing countries in the region, will result in an energy drain in the near future and will destroy our domestic economy</strong>: one quarter of our present GNP as well as one third of the budget is used for the purchase of oil. The search for raw materials in the Negev and on the coast will not, in the near future, serve to alter that state of affairs.

<strong>(Regaining) the Sinai peninsula with its present and potential resources is therefore a political priority</strong> which is obstructed by the Camp David and the peace agreements. The fault for that lies of course with the present Israeli government and the governments which paved the road to the policy of territorial compromise, the Alignment governments since 1967. The Egyptians will not need to keep the peace treaty after the return of the Sinai, and they will do all they can to return to the fold of the Arab world and to the USSR in order to gain support and military assistance. American aid is guaranteed only for a short while, for the terms of the peace and the weakening of the U.S. both at home and abroad will bring about a reduction in aid. Without oil and the income from it, with the present enormous expenditure, we will not be able to get through 1982 under the present conditions and <strong>we will have to act in order to return the situation to the status quo</strong> which existed in Sinai prior to Sadat’s visit and the mistaken peace agreement signed with him in March 1979.</blockquote>
This corroborates Hosein’s theory that an Israeli attack is impending on the Sinai, potentially in concert with NATO-aligned forces in Libya. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/150147#.TtfljLggcxX" target="_blank">Recent belligerent posturing</a><sup>(3)</sup> by an Israeli Member of the Knesset further backs up this idea.
<h3>Syria &amp; Iraq</h3>
Two other nations earmarked for destruction at the outset of the Zionist ‘War on Terror’ were Syria and Iraq. As Yinon’s paper demonstrates, these nations too are prime targets of Israel’s balkanisation plan.
<blockquote><strong>The dissolution of Syria and Iraq later on into ethnically or religiously unique areas such as in Lebanon, is Israel’s primary target on the Eastern front in the long run</strong>, while the dissolution of the military power of those states serves as the primary short term target. Syria will fall apart, in accordance with its ethnic and religious structure, into several states such as in present day Lebanon, so that there will be a Shi’ite Alawi state along its coast, a Sunni state in the Aleppo area, another Sunni state in Damascus hostile to its northern neighbor, and the Druzes who will set up a state, maybe even in our Golan, and certainly in the Hauran and in northern Jordan. This state of affairs will be the guarantee for peace and security in the area in the long run, and that aim is already within our reach today.
…
<strong>Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for Israel’s targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria. Iraq is stronger than Syria. In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to Israel.</strong> An Iraqi-Iranian war will tear Iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a wide front against us. Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up Iraq into denominations as in Syria and in Lebanon. In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi’ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north.</blockquote>
Not only is Syria now undergoing the major Zionist destabilisation plot prescribed in Yinon’s strategy, but this plot is being carried out on the ground with major Turkish military, operational, and territorial support. This is something that was recommended in Richard Perle’s ‘Clean Break’ rehashing of the strategy:
<blockquote>(Israel can) Work closely with Turkey and Jordan to contain, destabilize, and roll-back some of its most dangerous threats. This implies clean break from the slogan, “comprehensive peace” to a traditional concept of strategy based on balance of power.
…
<strong>Israel can shape its strategic environment, in cooperation with Turkey and Jordan, by weakening, containing, and even rolling back Syria. This effort can focus on removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq — an important Israeli strategic objective in its own right — as a means of foiling Syria’s regional ambitions.</strong>
…
Most important, it is understandable that Israel has an interest <strong>supporting diplomatically, militarily and operationally Turkey’s and Jordan’s actions against Syria, such as securing tribal alliances with Arab tribes that cross into Syrian territory and are hostile to the Syrian ruling elite.</strong></blockquote>
Readers will most likely be aware of General Wesley Clark’s ‘seven nations in five years’ testimony. Clark, a four star General in the United States Army stated that on September 12, 2001 – the day after Israel’s false flag – the United States had already made the decision to wage war on Iraq in spite of having no casus belli whatsoever. A few weeks after this, shortly after the start of the war on Afghanistan, Clark was shown a memo which named seven countries that the United States was to ‘take down’ in five years: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran. This is literally a laundry list of Israel’s targets; the ‘Israeli hand in the American glove’ metaphor becomes disconcertingly fitting and relevant:

&lt;iframe width="500" height="369" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SXS3vW47mOE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
<h3>Jordan &amp; the Palestinians</h3>
‘<em>A Strategy for the Nineteen Eighties</em>‘ recommends a ‘final solution’ to Israel’s ‘Palestinian problem’. After ethnically cleansing Palestinians from their land in 1948, Israel was unable to uproot the indigenous Arabs from the portion of Palestine that is now known as the West Bank. Though Israel occupied it in 1967, they were unable to force the entire population into flight.

Yinon’s plan calls for the native Palestinians of the West Bank to be pushed east over the river into Jordan, where they may establish a state. This, without compromise, is the only solution the Israeli colonists will accept – something which is evidenced by Israel’s continued and accelerated Jewish colonisation of the West Bank.
<blockquote>There is no chance that Jordan will continue to exist in its present structure for a long time, and Israel’s policy, both in war and in peace, ought to be directed at the <strong>liquidation of Jordan under the present regime and the transfer of power to the Palestinian majority. Changing the regime east of the river will also cause the termination of the problem of the territories densely populated with Arabs west of the Jordan.</strong> Whether in war or under conditions of peace, emigration from the territories and economic demographic freeze in them, are the guarantees for the coming change on both banks of the river, and we ought to be active in order to accelerate this process in the nearest future. The autonomy plan ought also to be rejected, as well as any compromise or division of the territories for, given the plans of the PLO and those of the Israeli Arabs themselves, the Shefa’amr plan of September 1980, it is not possible to go on living in this country in the present situation without separating the two nations, the Arabs to Jordan and the Jews to the areas west of the river. <strong>Genuine coexistence and peace will reign over the land only when the Arabs understand that without Jewish rule between the Jordan and the sea they will have neither existence nor security. A nation of their own and security will be theirs only in Jordan.</strong>

Within Israel the distinction between the areas of ’67 and the territories beyond them, those of ’48, has always been meaningless for Arabs and nowadays no longer has any significance for us. The problem should be seen in its entirety without any divisions as of ’67. It should be clear, under any future political situation or military constellation, that <strong>the solution of the problem of the indigenous Arabs will come only when they recognize the existence of Israel in secure borders up to the Jordan river and beyond it.</strong></blockquote>
<strong>The Atlantic boasts of a new Middle East</strong>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17526" title="middleeast-map" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/middleeast-map.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="322" />

A 2008 Atlantic article by Jewish Zionist Jeffrey Goldberg contained a very telling map of a possible future Middle East. Readers may recall that it was Jeffrey Goldberg <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dialogues/features/2002/should_the_us_invade_iraq_week_2/aflatoxin.html" target="_blank">who said in 2002</a><sup>(4)</sup> that Saddam Hussein “<em>could have an atomic bomb within months of acquiring fissile material</em>”, and that the genocidal war on Iraq would be “<em>remembered as an act of profound morality</em>”.

The map makes for very interesting viewing; it is literally a visual representation of the Israeli plan to remake the Middle East and North Africa. On the Horn of Africa we see Somalia split into three states, and Sudan broken into two (something which has actually happened since 2008). Eritrea is occupied by Ethiopia, signified by the striped colour-coding on the map, and the Egyptian Sinai is given the same treatment, presumably indicating an Israeli occupation.

Palestine is merged into Jordan, in line with the plan to push the Palestinians out of the West Bank and into a state on Jordanian territory.

Iraq has been balkanised with the creation of a Shia state, a Sunni state, and a Kurdish state in the north. This outcome is being avidly worked towards by Mossad and elite elements of the Israeli military, who have been <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.maskofzion.com/2011/01/occupied-iraq-new-year-same-zionism.html" target="_blank">fomenting Shia-Sunni sectarian conflict in Iraq for years</a>.<sup>(5)</sup> As a result, since the 2003 invasion the U.S. Military has constructed hundreds of miles of concrete walls in Iraqi cities, to separate the Sunni and the Shia from one another. Though most of these walls have since been torn down, their very presence is a manifestation of the Israeli plan to split Iraq on sectarian lines, “<em>So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and Mosul, and Shi’ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north.</em>”
<h3>Pakistan: Gateway to the Zionist Endgame</h3>
The first Prime Minister of Israel, David Ben Gurion, elucidated Israeli opposition to the state of Pakistan. His words, printed in the London Jewish Chronicle on August 9, 1967 – a matter of weeks after Israel’s conquest of the West Bank, Al Quds (Jerusalem), Gaza, and Syria’s Golan Heights – made Zionism’s staunch opposition to Pakistan crystal-clear:
<blockquote>The world Zionist movement should not be neglectful of the dangers of Pakistan to it. And Pakistan now should be its first target, for this ideological State is a threat to our existence. And Pakistan, the whole of it, hates the Jews and loves the Arabs.

<em>This lover of the Arabs is more dangerous to us than the Arabs themselves. For that matter, it is most essential for the world Zionism that it should now take immediate steps against Pakistan.</em>

<em>Whereas the inhabitants of the Indian peninsula are Hindus whose hearts have been full of hatred towards Muslims, therefore, India is the most important base for us to work there from against Pakistan.</em>

It is essential that we exploit this base and strike and crush Pakistanis, enemies of Jews and Zionism, by all disguised and secret plans.</blockquote>
Relatively recent comments from Israel’s repugnant, racist Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman corroborate this position, revealing that this Zionist strategy exists as a priority in the modern day. In a 2009 interview with a Russian daily newspaper, Soviet-born Lieberman (born <em>Evet Lvovich Liberman</em>) <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/23-Apr-2009/Israeli-FM-sees-Pakistan-biggest-threat" target="_blank">revealed</a><sup>(6)</sup> that he saw Pakistan as Israel’s biggest threat, as opposed to Iran which is commonly painted as Israel’s arch nemesis:
<blockquote>“Pakistan is nuclear and unstable and Afghanistan is faced with a potential Taliban takeover, and the combination forms a contiguous area of radicalism ruled in the spirit of Osama bin Laden,”</blockquote>
In the same interview Lieberman professed, “<em>Believe me, America accepts all our decisions</em>”, an arrogant but nevertheless valid analysis.

Briefly returning to the ‘Atlantic’ map, you will notice that Afghanistan has been disembowelled; the ethnic states of Baluchistan and Pashtunistan have been created, and the northern region of Afghanistan has been absorbed into ‘Persia’. As a result of the secession of Baluchistan and Pashtunistan (both of which straddle the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, while Baluch territory extends into Iran too), significant chunks of Pakistan have been lost. This is part of a long-standing Zionist policy to cripple Pakistan as a nation.

Pakistan is a proud Muslim nation which not only has an ideological opposition to Zionism and Western colonialism, but possesses nuclear weapons. The nuclear deterrent, partnered with a cohesive and loyal army and air force presents a significant roadblock to Zionist and Indian aspirations of hegemony.

Shahid Siddiqi of <em>Dawn.com</em> <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://archives.dawn.com/archives/67562" target="_blank">muses</a><sup>(7)</sup> that,
<blockquote>"Due to its defiance of Indian diktat, Pakistan is for India an obstruction in its quest for domination of South Asia and the Indian Ocean region. Israel's apprehension of Pakistan’s military prowess is rooted in the strength Pakistan indirectly provides to Arab states with whom Israel has remained in a state of conflict. Conscious that several Arab states look up to Pakistan for military support in the event of threat to their security from Israel, it is unsettling for Israel to see a nuclear armed Pakistan."</blockquote>
Again, this analysis gives a nod to David Ben Gurion’s position on Pakistan – echoed by Israel’s Foreign Minister over forty years later. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.maskofzion.com/2010/09/israel-and-india-brothers-in-occupation.html" target="_blank">Israel’s deep military-intelligence collaboration with India</a><sup>(8)</sup> is yet another indication of this strategy manifesting.

This strategy was transposed into an overt act of war when in 1984, Israel attempted to destroy Pakistan’s Kahuta nuclear reactor. After becoming aware of the plot, Pakistan spurned the attack by pre-emptively scrambling jets to protect the facility. To this day the strategy continues by overt and covert means.

In the midst of the Zionist ‘War on Terror’ in June 2004, George W. Bush began drone attacks on Pakistan. The deadly attacks, ostensibly launched against ‘Al Qaeda’ and Taliban ‘terrorists’ and ‘insurgents’, accelerated in regularity and intensity from 2004 to 2011 – killing thousands of innocent Pakistanis. The real underlying motive for these attacks is to foment unrest in these regions, with a view to provoking and cultivating militant secessionist groups. The aim is to turn these groups against the collaborationist Pakistani government (which is impotent in the face of naked aggression on the part of its American ‘ally’).

The balkanisation of Pakistan and seizure of its nuclear weapons are the ultimate aspirations of Israel as well as the United States, which aims to preserve its declining superpower status in the face of a growing China. A prominent meme in the Zionist media is the notion that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are unsafe and at risk of ‘falling into the wrong hands’. This is the very justification that will eventually be used to launch an all-out invasion of Pakistan whereby Western powers will seize its nuclear weapons. The drone strikes, NATO provocations, and CIA-Mossad-RAW black ops serve to fan the flames of unrest, creating the necessary climate for military action and eventual dismemberment of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. The close relationship between China and Pakistan is a significant factor in the drive to break up Pakistan. China’s port at Gwadar is known as one of her ‘String of Pearls’, being of huge strategic interest and allowing for an energy corridor through Pakistan.

The latest chapter in the war on Pakistan transpired on Saturday 26 November when <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/30/us-pakistan-nato-idUSTRE7AT0JZ20111130" target="_blank">NATO helicopter gunships slaughtered 24 Pakistani soldiers.</a><sup>(9)</sup> In a naked act of aggression, NATO helicopters attacked a Pakistani army post for 45 minutes, then returned 20 minutes later and attacked for a further hour. Predictably this has triggered furious protests in Pakistan, and intense anger at both NATO and the Pakistani military, criticised for not responding to protect the soldiers during the two-hour attack. In the final analysis however, this event has unified the Pakistani people.

After NATO’s inexcusable attack on Pakistan the Zionist deceptions immediately followed, in a stunningly predictable development.

On <strong>Saturday 13 August, 2011</strong> – over three months prior to the recent NATO attack – an American Jewish man named Warren Weinstein, working under the auspices of the U.S. government, was reportedly kidnapped by armed men in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore. Suspiciously, five days after the NATO attack, the S.I.T.E. Intelligence Group informs the world that ‘Al Qaeda’ have claimed in an audio message to be holding Weinstein. In a <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/al-qaeda-leader-zawahiri-us-hostage/story?id=15066701#.Ttkfa7ggcxU" target="_blank">profoundly shaky statement a U.S. official was quoted</a><sup>(10)</sup> as saying, “<em>It’s entirely possible that al Qaeda or one of its militant allies may be holding Mr. Weinstein, and the statement by Zawahiri supports this conclusion</em>”.

[caption id="attachment_17527" align="alignright" width="300" caption="Rita Katz: asset of the Zionist ‘War on Terror’ - faking intelligence for a fake war."]<img class="size-medium wp-image-17527" title="KatzChertoff" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/KatzChertoff-300x191.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="191" />[/caption]

Why would ‘Al Qaeda’ wait over three months to tell us?

Is it not convenient that, in S.I.T.E’s audio message, ‘Zawahiri’ also <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/al-qaida-israel-must-lift-gaza-siege-in-exchange-for-u-s-jewish-prisoner-1.399199" target="_blank">called for the lifting of the siege on Gaza</a>?<sup>(11)</sup> Israel has consistently tried to link the global ‘Free Gaza’ struggle to ‘Al Qaeda’. This has been the Zionist entity’s modus operandi ever since the Mavi Marmara was brutally attacked, whereafter <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/05/30/reports-israeli-ships-attack-aid-flotilla-dead/" target="_blank">Israel claimed the activists were linked to ‘Al Qaeda’</a>.<sup>(12)</sup>

Why are these ‘Al Qaeda’ audio messages invariably posted on ‘extremist websites’ that no independent person has access to and therefore can never be independently verified? Why is every such ‘Al Qaeda’ tape, without exception, found by S.I.T.E? This bizarre situation becomes clearer when we examine the S.I.T.E. Intelligence Group. Founded in 2002 at the outset of the ‘War on Terror’ by rabid Zionist and former IDF soldier Rita Katz (whose father was hanged in Baghdad for spying for Israel), S.I.T.E. is nothing more than the PR organ of the ‘War on Terror’. It exists to convince the world that the ‘Al Qaeda’ apparition is an eminent threat whenever and wherever it is required.

The invasion of Afghanistan was waged in the name of a number of important interests. It was an attempt to militarise Central Asia in order to counter the growing power of China, Iran, and Russia. It was meant to facilitate the construction of an energy pipeline to transport the rich energy reserves of the Caspian basin through Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, southern Pakistan, and from there to Western markets. However, even more importantly the occupation of Afghanistan serves as a precursor to the war on Pakistan. It allows Western forces to learn the territory and develop the necessary tactics. It allows them to become familiar with local groups who can be armed, trained, and used as proxy armies as we’ve seen in the Libya war.

When we read of drone strikes against ‘militants’ and alleged ‘Al Qaeda’ kidnappings in Pakistan, we must view them through an analytical lens; nothing is ever as it seems in this geopolitical hotspot. While kvetching that Pakistani nukes are unsafe and a threat to peace, Israel, the United States, and India are actively working to violently destabilise the country.

The ‘War on Terror’ is an utterly false paradigm shored up by the sea of deception put forth by the Zionist media and groups such as S.I.T.E. We must strip away this veneer to expose the motivations and strategies of the Zionist entity and its American lapdog – the nations which constitute the biggest threat to peace on the face of the planet.

<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

The Russian Federation does not need lessons on how to conduct its elections, much less does it need lessons from the United States of America and far less still from a female who waltzes off an aircraft to the sound of a band and claims she was entering a war zone. Suppose Hillary “War Zone” Clinton stuck her nose into her own affairs?

As predicted in this column a week ago before the Russian Parliamentary elections, the ruling party, Edinaya Rossiya, or United Russia, won the election by far, being the most voted party, having won the most seats and being far, far ahead of the second most popular party, the Communists. Let the figures speak for themselves.

United Russia won 238 of the 450 seats in the DUMA (Parliament), giving it a majority over the opposition parties (Communists, 92; Just Russia, 64 and Liberal Democratic Party, 56. Yabloko, Patriots of Russia and Right Cause did not elect any members). United Russia got 52.88% of the seat composition in the Duma, against 20.46% for the Communists, 14.21% for Just Russia, 12.45% for the Liberal Democratic Party and zero per cent for the other contenders. United Russia received 32,331,244 votes, against 12,594,232 for the Communists, 8,689,147 for Just Russia, 7,659,657 for the Liberal Democrats, 2,249,990 for Yabloko, 638,735 for the Patriots of Russia and 392,507 for the Right Cause. United Russia garnered just under 50% of the vote, the second most voted party, the Communists, less than 20%.

Now what does Hillary Clinton have to say about that? Jumping on the bandwagon as she did in her “war zone” welcome by a brass band in Bosnia, she calls for a “full investigation” after making an even more absurd claim that Vladimir Putin has suffered a “setback” while expressing her “serious concerns”. If getting 50% of the vote is a “setback” then Hillary “War Zone” Clinton is a burger short of the Barbie.

Supposing Hillary Clinton expressed “serious concerns” at the way her country and its European poodles behaved in Libya, openly taking the side of terrorists, rapists, thieves, arsonists, torturers and looters? Supposing Hillary Clinton expressed “serious concerns” at the way her country breached the UN Charter, the UNSC Resolutions and the Geneva Conventions? Supposing Hillary Clinton expressed “serious concerns” at the way the USA/NATO strafed civilian structures with military hardware, spreading freedom and democracy from 30,000 feet, murdering children and women, destroying public and private property and targeting civilian commodities such as the water supply and electricity grid “to break their backs”?

I do not remember Hillary Clinton uttering one word of condolence when a NATO coward murdered the grandchildren of Colonel Gaddafi, I do not remember hearing Hillary Clinton issuing a single word of apology as the armed forces of her country and its allies openly took sides in an internal conflict and murdered civilians.

So suppose Hillary Clinton took her “serious concerns” and addressed the ills inside her own country and the tremendous damage it is doing across the globe? Speaking of electoral fraud, the first election of Bush springs to mind, after which there was the illegal war in Iraq, the fiasco in Georgia when that tie-chewing freak and his wonderful military advisors ran screaming with their tails between their legs (sterling job those Military Advisors did, Hillary. Why don’t you send some more, eh what?), the illegal war in Libya, interference in Syria…we have the government of the United States of America promising to close down the concentration and torture camp at Guantanamo and four years on it is still there, we have the USA synonymous with torture, setting dogs on illegally detained persons, urinating in food, sleep deprival and sodomy by guards on prisoners… so as Secretary of State, should Hillary Clinton not be addressing this legacy instead of sticking her nose in where it is not called for?

And suppose Hillary Clinton minded her own business, and set her own house in order, for Russia does not need lessons in how to conduct its internal policies, especially not from a female such as this. In an election there are winners and losers and for me, getting 50% of the vote is a clear win, the more so when the second placed party gets under 20%. Or what is wrong with Hillary Clinton, would she prefer that the Communist Party had won? Or is she a burger short of the Barbie?

As for those who are trying to insinuate that the paltry turn-out of “protesters” in Moscow and St. Petersburg are the beginning of an “Arab Spring”, the answer is that this is not an Arab Spring, but a Russian Winter, when people drink vodka to keep warm and when a certain type of citizen will do anything if an agent provocateur pays him/her to turn out at a protest, specially in the run-up to the festive season. And for those looking for trouble, the right to hold a demonstration is a very clear part of the Russian Constitution. Did anyone see the police in Russia behaving like the American police did on Wall Street when they clashed with the Occupy protesters?

No, I thought not. Then Hillary “War Zone” Clinton, you are as effective a Secretary of State as your predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, as she snarled around the world dropping snide comments and today sits cringing as she scuttles from lecture to lecture being heckled for being a war criminal. She at least could play the piano. And you? How about taking your intrusiveness, arrogance and insolence back to Chicago or Arkansas where they belong?]]></content:encoded>

<em>Review Report: Geoengineering the Ozone Layer.</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/david-stephen/" target="_blank">David Stephen</a></strong>

<a href="http://trpns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ozone-Hole-Repair.pdf">Ozone Layer Geoengineering</a>  ̶  or <a href="http://trpns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Geoengineering-The-Ozone-Layer.pptx">OLG</a> for short  ̶  is a geoengineering procedure that submits a solution to ozone layer depletion if it poses risks to man or the environment now or in future. Ozone layer depletion is commonly observed in the atmosphere over Antarctica and Arctic; this environmental risk will be relatively insignificant if a major depletion is found over a country or continent.

Ozone layer depletion is an <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/11/22/more-diseases-ozone-diminishes.html" target="_blank">environmental headache</a> and Green House Gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere also contributes to it  ̶  this submits further reasons for <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.groundreport.com/Opinion/Geoengineering-and-Ozone-Monitoring/2942610" target="_blank">ozone monitoring</a>. Ozone depletion and issues surrounding it will come as less of a major problem because of the <a href="http://trpns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ozone-Hole-Repair.pdf">OLG</a> procedure that is safe and workable for desired results.

Global warming for now is a serious issue to the planet and agreement to hang its cause is on a flight with direction but without controls. Several effects lie with global warming because of increase in average temperature of the earth and that the total danger it holds is unknown.

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.groundreport.com/World/2100-Climate-Change-and-Global-Warming-Expectancy/2940764" target="_blank">Climate change</a> for some is already happening and for others may happen in years ahead if global emissions whisk past the tipping point  ̶  that will increase the earth’s average temperature by 2<sup>o</sup>C and beyond. Climate change as we have now or may have later has no <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.examiner.com/environmental-news-in-rochester/can-we-address-climate-change-at-all-or-are-we-too-stupid" target="_blank">historical equivalent</a> and may just be one war all humans will consciously fight to keep the future.

The problems of this present world are many as different people and governments have biting challenges  ̶  at the moment  ̶  and most of them take that more seriously than climate change that is “not really” happening now and not happening for their actions alone.

The United Nations summit on climate change ongoing in Durban, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.cop17-cmp7durban.com/en/about-cop17-cmp7/greening-cop17-cmp7.html" target="_blank">COP 17</a> is supposed to be a ground for agreement and reality but is a ground for arguments and delusion. Nations should agree against climate change, we know, but economic prosperity and emissions prosperity go together. Sharp cuts to the latter will down efforts to grow the former  ̶  struggling globally for now to recovery.

This reality is what developed nations accused of pronging proposals like the Green Climate Fund and <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.groundreport.com/World/Global-warming-Climate-Change-Technology-Transfer-_1/2941452" target="_blank">Technology Transfer</a> are trying to make others understand. Some are trying to keep their reputation by not signing certain agreements for the sake of a conference and default on their part later on.

Saying NO for now is better than saying YES to chill the offensive and bring their nations to disrepute. Certain other nations might not really bother about their role but will sign on and use future eventualities as the excuse of default. The US is at the center of the climate change debate as the very wealthy and very big polluter that does not want to cooperate.

Some blame can go to the US from some who <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.huffingtonpost.com/joss-garman/obama-climate-change_b_1127748.html" target="_blank">believe</a> they understand what the US should do and how they can do it. The question that slogs the chord is for developing nations that are also big polluters especially India and China; India is developing and should benefit from the Green Climate Fund but India is now a top polluter, can contributions come from there too?

Reality takes its leave in these UN meetings since “an idea by those that conceived it is now being used against them even when things have clearly changed and everyone can see”. This whole thing is having scientists think about a quick fix for global warming to postpone effects of climate change for now or in future.

<em>Harald Doornbos stole at least 18 kilos of belongings of the Qaddafi family. Photo: a stolen poster from Muammar Qaddafi's Tripoli house (nu.nl).</em>

A man's shirt, private notes, flags, family photographs and the passport of Dodi the cat. Just some of the 18 kilos (some media say 20 kilos) of stuff Dutch journalist <a href="http://twitter.com/haralddoornbos" target="_blank">Harald Doornbos</a> has stolen from the ransacked houses of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in Tripoli and Sirte by the end of August. He calls the goods 'rubbish with a story'.

The family photos (see images below) were stolen by the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.gpd.nl/" target="_blank">GPD</a> Middle East correspondent from one of Qaddafi's houses in Sirte. Unable to deny the fact that Muammar Qaddafi has always been a kind, wonderful, generous, loving and caring person and familiy man, Doornbos says: "The photos give a special impression of the façade of normal domesticity of a crazy dictator."

He is most excited about the theft of the cat passport, as in his perception "cat Dodi is now the only Qaddafi who is still in Libya."

Doornbos doesn't consider his criminal acts as stealing at all. Talking to the Dutch press, he explains: "This criticism comes from people who never have been in such a situation themselves. The moment I was in the houses in Tripoli and Sirte, the rebels were destroying everything. I was thinking: 'If I leave this stuff there, it will simply disappear'."

The stolen goods are currently <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.kickstartbreda.nl/" target="_blank">exhibited</a> in Breda, the Netherlands,  till December 16.

The Libyan Ambassador to the Netherlands, a NATO-puppet who has expressed his appreciation of the exhibition of the illegally obtained stuff, has asked to hand the belongings of the Qaddafi family over to the Libyan rebels, which Doornbos agreed on.

Below is a photo impression of the stuff Harald Doornbos has stolen from the houses of the Qaddafi family in Tripoli and Sirte:

[caption id="attachment_17603" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Experts say families need to take a critical look at vaccines."]<img class="size-full wp-image-17603" title="vaccine1" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/vaccine1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="385" />[/caption]

<strong>By S. Edmonson</strong>

<em>"The chief, if not the sole, cause of the monstrous increase in cancer has been vaccination" - Dr. Robert Bell, once Vice President International Society for Cancer Research at the British Cancer Hospital.</em>

Have you been rushing out to get a yearly flu vaccine or diligently taking your children for the 40 or so mandated childhood vaccines?

That's really a shame because you have unwittingly been trading a run-of-the-mill flu or just the measles, for loading up your or your children's bodies with cancer and other deadly viruses, a destructive bacteria, a chemical selected to damage fertility, and with synthetic DNA that threatens to damage your own DNA - the biologic code for your existence.

Who is saying the vaccines are contaminated?

None other than the (now deceased) head of vaccines at Merck, <strong>Dr. Maurice Hillerman</strong>, who <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvsXrVkjyz4" target="_blank">on camera </a>admitted that Merck's Hepatitis B vaccines, contaminated with a virus, caused the AIDS epidemic in the US.  He went on to say that all of Merck's vaccines are contaminated with cancer and other viruses. (The US government has <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/us-concedes-hep-b-causes-lupus/" target="_blank">conceded the HEB B vaccine causes Lupus</a>. That vaccine is mandated for every infant in the US on the day of birth, and is associated with MS as well.)

For Jews who have almost religiously believed in medical authorities about vaccines and poo-pooed those worried about the safety of vaccines, they might want to notice that Hillerman was Jewish.

Or they might recognize that so is <strong>Dr. Larry Palevsky</strong>, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/11/14/Expert-Pediatrician-Exposes-Vaccine-Myths.aspx" target="_blank">a board certified NY pediatrician</a>, who for ten years routinely gave vaccines to his patients until he noticed them losing eye contact and then began looking into the vaccines he had blindly trusted.  He found that they are ALL contaminated with viruses that are so small they can never be removed.  He no longer gives any vaccines.  He now treats his young patients for autism and other neurologic injuries from vaccines.

Donald W. Scott, the editor of The Journal of Degenerative Diseases and the co-founder of the Common Cause Medical Research Foundation, links vaccines to AIDS (as did Hillerman) and to US bio-weapons research, and says they are contaminated with mycoplasma, a primitive bacteria that takes apart cell walls.

Perhaps the highest scientific authority saying vaccines are contaminated is Garth Nicolson. He is a cell biologist and editor of the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Metastasis, and the Journal of Cellular Biochemistry. He is one of the most cited scientists in the world, having published over 600 medical and scientific peer-reviewed papers, edited over 14 books, and served on the editorial boards of 28 medical and scientific journals. He is not just saying that vaccines are contaminated with mycoplasma but is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk-RMI4qNvA" target="_blank">warning the US</a> that they are. Nicolson goes further and says that we are all being damaged by them and contracting chronic degenerative diseases caused by them.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lU12h6lWi9I&amp;NR=1" target="_blank">That damage translates into lifelong patients</a> (and thus life-long profit) for the pharmaceutical industry making the vaccines and he says it doesn't appear to be accidental.
<p align="center">According to CIA Statistics:</p>
<p align="center">As Shots Increase, U.S. Lifespan Is DECREASING</p>

<strong> 2009: 36 vaccine$ before age 5</strong>
<strong> 2010: 55 vaccine$ before age 6</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17617" title="statistics" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/statistics1-500x181.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="181" /></p>
All the vaccines mandated to children and many other vaccines as well, including the seasonal flu vaccines being mandated to health care workers, are contaminated with polysorbate 80, the central ingredient in a pharmaceutical industry patent to damage fertility. The pharmaceutical industry has a long history of <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.salem-news.com/articles/november072011/experiments-auschwitz-rg.php" target="_blank">seeking a vaccine that would covertly sterilize whole populations</a>. So, in addition to being contaminated with cancer and other viruses, and with the bacteria mycoplasma, vaccines are intentionally "contaminated" with a chemical as well, which is, given the patent, a "patently" <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://organichealthadviser.com/archives/polysorbate-80-in-swine-flu-vaccines-infertility-in-humans" target="_blank">sought-after sterilizing agent</a>.

Beyond containing polysorbate 80 and cancer and other viruses, and likely mycoplasma, the Gardasil vaccines are contaminated in an additional way. It, and all the new vaccines, are <a href="http://goog_1613772300/" target="_blank">contaminated</a><a href="http://coto2.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/murdoch-and-vaccines-exposure-of-murdochs-crimes-expose-a-much-larger-story/" target="_blank"> with genetically engineered DNA</a>.  It can contaminate people's DNA, just as genetically engineered crops can contaminate normal crops.  Gardasil itself is <a href="http://coto2.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/in-6-countries-mercks-gardisil-contaminated-with-ge-viral-hpv/" target="_blank">contaminated</a> with a man-made version of the HPV DNA, the very virus it was supposed to protect against, which now threatens not only altering kids' healthy DNA with synthetic DNA (!), but with a diseased version.

Gardasil was suspended in India after 4 girls died, but the killing has gone on in the US despite the confirmed deaths of 100 girls. And now the CDC, with special ties to Merck, its maker, wants all boys to take it, too.

Informed consent is the core of the Nuremberg Code that was created by the Nuremberg Tribunal to keep the pharmaceutical industry from ever again committing the hideous "medical" abuses it did during the Holocaust. In California, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?https://rdt.mercola.com/view.aspx?Email=llcohencole@gmail.com&amp;ReturnURL=http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/11/15/bills-that-restrict-californian-health-freedom.aspx?e_cid=20111115_DNL_art_2" target="_blank">Jerry Brown is dismantling informed consent</a> in order to get these deadly  vaccines <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://community.babycenter.com/post/a7628435/gardasil_cause_of_infertility" target="_blank">associated with infertility</a>, into all school children.  And it was during the Holocaust that the pharmaceutical experimented on Jewish women prisoners at Auschwitz <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.salem-news.com/articles/november072011/experiments-auschwitz-rg.php" target="_blank">to develop a vaccine that sterilized covertly</a>.  Henry Kissinger <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.thepetitionsite.com/1/a-universal-declaration-of-resistance-to-mandatory-vaccinations/" target="_blank">recommended the development of covertly sterilizing vaccines</a> in a major report to the US government and, as late as 2009, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHur7u13woc" target="_blank">Finnish Health Minister</a> said he was behind the H1N1 vaccine that was meant to lower population.

Jerry Brown has just signed into law a bill that will allow children as young as 12 to decide whether to take a vaccine for sexually transmitted disease. Parental consent is not needed and parents will not even be allowed knowledge as to whether the child has taken the vaccine. Merck's Hepatitis B vaccine is one that is included, as is another Merck vaccine, Gardasil, allegedly for ovarian cancer.  A Gardasil researcher says there is <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/08/19/cbsnews_investigates/main5253431.shtml" target="_blank">no evidence it works</a>. "This raises questions about the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/STDFact-HPV-vaccine-young-women.htm" target="_blank">CDC's recommendation</a> that the series of shots be given to girls as young as 11-years old. 'If we vaccinate 11 year olds and the protection doesn't last... we've put them at harm from side effects, small but real, for no benefit,' says Dr. Harper. 'The benefit to public health is nothing, there is no reduction in cervical cancers … ' "

Current Data for Gardasil up to August 12, 2011

Disabled: 763
Deaths: 103
Did Not Recover: 4777
Abnorm. Pap Smear: 430
Cervical Dysplasia: 157
Cervical Cancer: 41
Life Threatening: 444
Emergency Rm. Visit: 9115

Hospitalized: 2307
Extended Hosp. Stay: 201
Serious: 3111
Adverse Events: 23388

But these figures are based on statistics from medical professionals who do not wish to be sued. In reality, "less than 10% of deaths, seizures, paralysis, etc., are being reported as caused by the vaccinations that doctors gave in their office.

The following real-world estimates are based on reports from a law firm:
<blockquote>840 young girls and 2 boys have died after receiving the Gardasil HPV Vaccine 201,010 young girls have suffered debilitating events such as fatigue, seizures, paralysis, etc. after receiving the Gardasil HPV Vaccine.</blockquote>
The California law even approves in advance, ALL yet-to-be-made (and completely untested) vaccines for sexually transmitted diseases, though of the two current Merck vaccines they are pushing on children, one Merck vaccine caused AIDS and causes Lupus and the other Merck vaccine is contaminated in multiple ways and proving highly lethal. Children will be the ones who decide whether to take the vaccines, and they will make that decision after being forced to see videos of people dying terrible deaths from cancer. Not only would the vaccine be given without parental consent, but parents are denied knowledge that the vaccine is going to be given or that it was given. If the child has a seizure or dies afterward, parents may not see their own children's medical records.

This is what is left of the "informed consent" meant to provide human rights to protect the world from pharmaceutical industry abuses against mankind.

After World War II, it was <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.whale.to/b/nazi_allopathy.html" target="_blank">Merck which received the flight capital</a> of the pharmaceutical industry indicted for crimes against humanity, human enslavement and mass murder.

In the case of children, rather than their facing <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.jinipatelthompson.com/html/2.html" target="_blank">childhood diseases of insignificant threat</a>, they are, by legal mandate, being bombarded repeatedly throughout their childhood with viruses that cause diseases (including cancer), a cell-destroying bacteria, a threat to the very integrity of their DNA, and a chemical specifically chosen to impair fertility.  And laws are being written to add to the already long list of vaccines they must take, including two mandated Merck vaccines.  One is an old Merck vaccine that caused AIDS and is causing Lupus.  The other is a Merck vaccine claiming to prevent cervical cancer though girls have little chance of contracting it in the first place (and boys, none!) and it can easily be detected by Pap smear and treated successfully and there is NO evidence the vaccine prevents it.  Meanwhile, it is killing children.

Contamination of the polio vaccine and <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://deathbyvaccination.com/" target="_blank">the continuing effects</a>.

FACT: Before the Polio Vaccine, there had never been a virus from another species deliberately injected into humans.

FACT: 61% of all human tumors (at autopsy) now contain <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://rense.com/general94/bill.htm" target="_blank">the SV40 monkey virus</a>, traceable to the Polio vaccine of the 1950s and 60s.

FACT: CUTTER vaccine division and WYETH produced a deadly Polio vaccine with a live virus that actually gave the recipient POLIO.

FACT: All above information was withheld from the public for years to avoid a public panic and to prevent a loss of faith in vaccines. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.whale.to/vaccine/bayly.html" target="_blank">Polio was a very rare infectious disease</a> that presented little risk to the public, but the risk was greatly exaggerated by the Polio Foundation before the introduction of the  polio vaccine, the miracle vaccine - contaminated with a monkey virus which has been the cause of soft tissue cancers for decades since.

Though facing no serious health risk, people are paying to have their bodies contaminated by contaminated vaccines.  In taking vaccines, they are trading the minimal risk of even contracting common diseases and which themselves are rarely dangerous and can be treated if contracted - for the absolute certainty of loading their bodies with

1. cancer and other infectious viruses,

2. a destructive bacteria, and

3. a fertility impairing chemical.

They are doing this because they are being terrorized by their own government <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/10/24/CBS-Reveals-that-Swine-Flu-Cases-Seriously-Overestimated.aspx" target="_blank">with false information</a> on the risks of various diseases and denied critical information on <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.thinktwice.com/s_misc.htm" target="_blank">the scientific risk of the vaccines</a>.

Those vaccines, without a doubt, threaten their own and their children's fertility, and their very lives.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Iranian President Orders Official Start of Lowering Ties with Britain</title>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17621" title="Iranian-President-Mahmoud-Ahmadinejad-" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Iranian-President-Mahmoud-Ahmadinejad-.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" />
<em>Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Wednesday communicated the law on downgrading political ties with Britain with the country's Foreign Ministry.</em>

The Iranian president communicated the law with the ministry of foreign affairs on Wednesday requiring the ministry to officially start lowering the relations with London in all economic and political grounds.

On November 20, Iranian legislators approved the bill of a law on downgrading relations with Britain with 179 yes votes, 4 oppositions and 11 abstentions. The 4 oppositions demanded a full cut of ties with London.

A day later, the Guardian Council endorsed the approval of the parliament which requires the government to downgrade the country's relations with Britain.

Yet, thousands of university students who were angry at Britain's growing hostilities towards Iran occupied the British embassy for a couple of hours in a show of protest at London's inimical stances and in demand for a full cut of ties with Britain.

The embassy attack was an outpouring of the wrath of the Iranian people who believe Britain is a hostile country seeking to damage and weaken the Islamic Republic.

The developments in Tehran came a week after the US and Britain targeted Iranian financial sectors with new punitive measures, including sanctions on the Iran's Central Bank and petrochemical industry.

The sanction against the Central Bank of Iran (CBI) and Iran's petrochemical industry was adopted in a unilateral move by the US, Canada and Britain outside the UN Security Council as other council members, specially Russia and China, had earlier warned against any fresh punitive measure, including sanctions, against Iran.

The British government has also embarked on delisting the anti-Iran terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO) from its list of terrorist groups.

The MKO terrorist group is deemed as the main enemy of the Iranian nation.

On February 7, more than 30 Iranian legislators had signed the single-urgency for introducing the bill of the law on cutting political relations with Britain to the parliament and submitted the bill to Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani for a final approval by all their colleagues.

The 35 Iranian lawmakers who signed the preliminary bill described London's direct and indirect interference in Iran's internal affairs, hostile remarks and stances of the British officials against Tehran, financial support for seditious acts in Iran, media propaganda and spying activities against Iran as their reasons for supporting and introducing the bill.

Last December, the National Security and Foreign Policy commission submitted the bill to the parliament's presiding board for final discussions and approval by all parliament members.

The Iranian lawmakers initially started drafting a bill to downgrade ties with London after Britain's direct involvement in stirring post-election unrests in Iran in 2009, but they intensified and accelerated the move after former British Envoy to Tehran Simon Gass criticized the human rights situation in Iran.

"Today, International Human Rights Day is highlighting the cases of those people around the world who stand up for the rights of others - the lawyers, journalists and NGO workers who place themselves at risk to defend their countrymen," Gass said in a memo published by the British Embassy in Tehran on December 9.

"Nowhere are they under greater threat than in Iran. Since last year human rights defenders have been harassed and imprisoned," Gass added.

Other lawmakers, including head of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Iranian parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, had previously blasted the negative role of the British ambassador to Tehran, and asked the country's foreign ministry to expel him from Iran.

Following Britain's support for a group of wild demonstrators who disrespected Islamic sanctities and damaged private and public amenities and properties in Tehran on December 27, 2009, members of the parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission drafted bill of a law requiring the country's Foreign Ministry to cut relations with Britain.

The British government's blatant stance and repeated remarks in support of the last year unrests inside Iran and London's espionage operations and financial and media support for the opposition groups are among the reasons mentioned in the bill for cutting ties with Britain.

Iran has repeatedly accused the West of stoking post-election unrests, singling out Britain and the US for meddling. Tehran expelled two British diplomats and arrested a number of local staffs of the British embassy in Tehran after documents and evidence substantiated London's interfering role in stirring post-election riots in Iran.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Mohammadi Golpayegani: "Bringing down the US spy drone was a great move and a sign of the deterrence capabilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Armed Forces."</em>

Head of the Supreme Leader's Office, Hojatoleslam Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani, praised Iran's Armed Forces for downing a US stealth aircraft being used for secret missions by the CIA, and said it displayed the high level of Tehran's deterrence power.

"Bringing down the US spy drone was a great move and a sign of the deterrence capabilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Armed Forces," Mohammadi Golpayegani said on Wednesday.

He underlined the high capabilities and power of the Iranian Armed Forces in foiling enemies' plots and parrying possible aggressions, and said, "The westerners themselves have even admitted that the downing of the US drone was a big move since the electronic systems of this kind of aircraft is impenetrable."

US officials had earlier admitted the unmanned surveillance plane lost by the United States in Iran was a stealth aircraft being used for secret missions by the CIA.

The officials said Iran's military appears to be in possession of one of the more sensitive surveillance platforms in the CIA's fleet, an aircraft that was shaped and designed to evade enemy defenses.

The mission of the downed drone has remained unclear. The RQ-170 has been used by the CIA for highly sensitive missions into other nations' airspace, including months of surveillance of the compound in Pakistan in which Osama bin Laden was hiding before he was killed in a May raid by Special Operations forces.

The disclosure that the drone recovered by Iran was being flown by the CIA comes after previous signals from US officials that had created the impression that the plane was being flown by the US military on a more mundane mission over Afghanistan and had simply strayed into Iranian territory.

Iran announced on Sunday that its defense forces downed the aircraft through a sophisticated cyber attack.

The RQ-170 has special coatings and a batwing shape designed to help it penetrate other nations' air defenses undetected. The existence of the aircraft, which is made by Lockheed Martin, has been known since 2009, when a model was photographed at the main US airfield in Kandahar, Afghanistan.

On December 8, Iran displayed the captured US drone:

 07 December 2011 
TEHRAN - An informed source in the Iranian military has said that Russian and Chinese officials have asked for permission to inspect the U.S. spy drone that was recently downed by the Iranian Armed Forces, Nasimonline.ir reported on Wednesday. 

On Sunday, an unidentified Iranian military source said that the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic had downed an advanced RQ-170 unmanned U.S. spy plane, which had violated the country’s airspace along the eastern border. 

There are unconfirmed reports that Iran may put the drone on public display.

According to the Washington Post, the RQ-170 drone has been used by the CIA for highly sensitive missions into other nations’ airspace, including months of surveillance of the compound in Pakistan in which Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was allegedly hiding before he was killed in an attack by Special Operations forces on May 1, 2011. 

On Monday, U.S. military officials said that they are concerned that Tehran may now have an opportunity to acquire information about the classified surveillance drone program, AP reported. 

U.S. officials considered conducting a covert mission inside Iran to retrieve or destroy the stealth drone but ultimately concluded such a secret operation wasn’t worth the risk of provoking a more explosive clash with Tehran, a U.S. official said, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Hansel,

Thank you for the interesting article you posted in the comment above this one as well as for the also interesting article you posted in a comment on this article: http://pub.mathaba.net/2011/12/08/syrian-president-bashar-al-assads-claims-crazy-says-us/

However, this isn’t really the right place to do so, as this site is just a ‘publication bridge’, meaning articles which eventually will be published at http://www.mathaba.net can be submitted here like you have done yourself several times, while the commenting system here is meant for anything regarding the editorial process of the submitted/published articles at this site Mathaba Publication Bridge and not really for anything else.

So if you want to share any interesting article, then best is to submit the article here via Add New => Post, or if you want to place a comment on the content of a published article at this site, then best is to wait till admin has posted a link in a comment on the actual article, which link you can click to find the published article at http://www.mathaba.net where you can place the comment.

Other ways to share things are http://www.mathaba.org, http://www.mathaba.info and (highly recommended) http://social.mathaba.net.

Thanks. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

&nbsp;

<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

As the Old Boys’ Club which has become the Merkozy space gets set to meet again on Friday and as the Dynamic Duo get ready to lecture the obedient schoolboys and girls sitting in nice straight rows, DWD Cameron flexes his muscles, paces and coughs in the wings. Don’t hold out too many hopes – the spineless jellyfish will fold like a house of cards.

<strong>Dear Heads of State and Government of the European Union,</strong>
<strong> Ladies and Gentlemen,</strong>

As you get set to once again side-step the democratic institutions you were elected to represent, as you once again in your collective pig-headed sheer and unadulterated arrogance ready yourselves to sell the 500 million citizens of Europe down the river, taking decisions over our heads, imposing currencies on us that we never asked for, destroying our industries and fishing sectors and agriculture, reducing jobs down the line for our children and grandchildren, adopting pan-European strategies in which Brussels can “punish” a country for not obeying the rules, you will not even spare a thought for us will you?

In fact all that has been going around your vapid and empty heads is stupid Euro soundbites, like “The Progress of the (Portuguese) people in the European Economic Space”, as you practised laboratory policies and thrust them upon five thousand years of collective history in which each and every idiotic experiment to create a Federal State out of a (wonderful) hotchpotch of nationalities and cultures and identities, where in places the language and traditions change every fifty or so miles, failed. More often than not, disastrously.

The last five thousand years of history have taught us to stand side by side as friends, working together as brothers and sisters but fundamentally respecting these differences, something which you people, in your collective stupidity, have wholly and totally failed to do. And what have you and your friends done?

Well, you have done very well for yourselves, haven’t you? You have created several echelons at the European level which will easily absorb failed politicians at home, so those who cannot make it in Stockholm or Berlin or Lisbon can gravitate between Strasbourg, Brussels or Luxembourg earning a lot for doing very little, except for ruining the Continent for the rest of us, who never voted for these faceless wonders. Charles the Rash of Burgundy would not believe his eyes if he teleported himself 500 years into the future, for the Duchy he led to destruction and assimilation by his enemies through his own rashness and impudence now rides roughshod over the rest of Europe.

And the rashness and impudence continues. While you created these jobs for the boys and girls, you also created surreptitiously the European Youth Parliament for your kids. Nice one, how much am I paying for that? And for those who think the Euro Institutions are three, take a closer look – there are literally dozens of them. NOW we start to see why they are getting so desperate to hold this ridiculous idea together.

And how much am I paying for you to destroy this Continent before my eyes? Why did you pay farmers not to produce? Why did you order them to bury their crops rather than sell them or even give them away? Why did you finance the decommissioning of fishing fleets? Why did you destroy our industries? We know very well why.

And here it is: What Hitler failed to do through arms, a disgusting clique of specialists has managed to steer the project through by using deceit and cynicism as your policies were forced upon the people usually without Referendums but then if they did exist, the wording was changed to “Plan A you lose, Plan B we win”. And this loathsome troop of opportunists did it because of the cowardice or connivance of those traitors who sold their people’s interests down the sewer, either knowingly or because they were too arrogant and short-sighted to see what they were doing.

The rest of you follow suit, declaring as you go to these Summits that you will go there with an open mind and a flexible approach, meaning that you will nod obediently and say “Thank you sir!” and “Thank you Ma’am” when Sarkozy and Merkel bark orders at you, tell you to shut up, listen and do as you are told, because have you noticed who controls Europe’s agriculture and industry sectors these days?

Nobody asked for this, nobody wanted that stupid single currency, the Euro, nobody wants Brussels telling them what to do and punishing them for what they did not do, and anyway guess who gets punished? Is it the moron who signed the paper representing his people, or is it the people themselves?

The only way out is to go back to where we were before Maastricht, before you all got caught up in that puerile wave of euphoria slapping one another’s backs in an orgy of Euroglee as you created Lebensraum for German industries. If I am supposed to perform as a German does, then give me a German salary and create equal conditions in the economy into which I am inserted. You cannot have it both ways – your Federal State is something which would have to be created over many decades and with intelligence, only after the vast majority of the European States enjoy the same economic vectors.

The people of the European Union did not want the Euro and we do not want the Fiscal Union, we do not want Europe to come closer together, we want it to move further apart. If any of you knew what you were doing, and from your stupid comments “nobody knows” we see that you do not, then you would be aware that the way forward is not to reiterate the same stupid catchphrases and implement a failed policy but to foment development by allowing economies to be competitive again and that means allowing their industries to flourish (instead of destroying them) and allowing countries to use the leverage of their own currency.

We know very well where your “calamity scenario” speech is coming from, because you know perfectly well that the mechanism to leave the Euro is as simple as communicating the desire to the European Council (Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon) and then adopting intelligent strategies which lesson the negative impact and favour the creation of cushions through liberalising lending and borrowing regimes, pegging currencies and by, for once at least, using goodwill.

What could and should be done in the name of the people of Europe will not, simply because you are collectively a bunch of sickening opportunists, at worst and pith-headed, pea-brained incompetents, at best.

The in-house cabaret entertainment on Friday will be watching Cameron the Chameleon turn himself into all sorts of weird and wonderful shapes and colours as he extricates himself from promising his people a referendum, which they, and the rest of Europe want.

The bottom line is we, the people, do not want your Eurospace. Get it?

The US says Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is disconnected from reality or "crazy" after he argued that he is not responsible for killing thousands of protesters.

State Department spokesman, Mark Toner, reiterated the US view that Assad has lost legitimacy and should step down after the Syrian leader said in a US television interview that "only a crazy person" would kill his own people.

"It either says that he's completely lost any power that he had within Syria, that he's simply a tool or that he's completely disconnected with reality," Toner told reporters.

"It's either disconnection, disregard or, as he said, crazy. I don't know," Toner said.
White House spokesman Jay Carney earlier said that Assad's views were "not credible."

Assad said in an interview with Barbara Walters on ABC News that no government in the world would kill its people "unless it's led by a crazy person" and said he did not "own" the security forces carrying out the violence.]]></content:encoded>

Thu Nov 24, 2011 4:3PM
A file photo shows members of the militant 'Free Syria Army' at a hideout on northern Lebanon's border with Syria.
A prominent political analyst says that members of the anti-government "Free Syria Army” are not defected army personnel but militants backed, funded and armed by the United States, Israel, and Turkey.

In an article published on Global Research website on November 20, Thailand-based geopolitical expert Tony Cartalucci cited a report released by the International Institute for Strategic Studies stating that Syria's opposition is armed and prepared to drag the country into more violence.

“The report comes in sharp contrast to the propaganda fed via the corporate-media and the West's foreign ministers on a daily basis, where the violence is portrayed as one-sided, with Syria's President Bashar al-Assad 'gunning down' throngs of peaceful, placard waving protesters,” Cartalucci wrote.

He said the group calling itself a pro-democracy movement is turning out to be a militant group of extremists trained by British and US intelligence agencies, “whose leadership is harbored in London and Washington and their foot soldiers supplied a steady stream of covert military support and overt rhetorical support throughout the compromised corporate media.”

The article described the unrest in Syria, which has killed thousands of people including hundreds of security personnel, as funded by Western corporate-financier interests and part of a long-planned agenda for regime change across the Middle East region.

Cartalucci said the regime change in Syria was planned to happen as early as 1991.

He said Washington's threats against Syria, which it listed in 2002 under then President George W. Bush as an “Axis of Evil,” were later realized as secret backing for opposition groups inside Syria.

Cartalucci cited an admission made by US State Department officials in April to attempt to “build the kind of democratic institutions” in Syria, and that Damascus perceived the move “as a threat to its control over the Syrian people."

Secret government cables published by US media had earlier revealed Washington has been funding Syrian opposition groups since at least 2005 and continued until today, the article concluded.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Boom of wind power energy in North-East Brazil: 11.2 MW by 2014</title>

[caption id="attachment_17646" align="alignnone" width="400" caption="France&#39;s Alstom opened a wind turbine manufacturing plant in Bahia."]<img class="size-full wp-image-17646" title="WIND FARM" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/WIND-FARM.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />[/caption]

<em>Brazil is going through a wind power boom as production prices fall and government incentives attract a growing number of foreign suppliers. The wind power sector has a current capacity of around 1,400 megawatts, and is expected to grow nearly eight-fold by 2014, according to the Brazilian Association of Wind Energy ABEEolica.</em>

Furthermore, a study by IHS Emerging Energy Research says Brazil, already Latin America's leading wind energy market, is expected to have 31.6 Gigawatts of installed capacity by 2025.

At a government-organized power auction last August, developers of 44 wind farms in Brazil won 39% of the total capacity contracted an average price of 99.58 Real (62.91 dollars) per megawatt-hour, offering for the first time a price below the average for two gas projects (103.26 Real) and a hydroelectric one (102 Real).

Lower production prices, government incentives and Brazil's soaring electricity demand have attracted a number of significant foreign players.

Wobben Windpower, a subsidiary of German group Enercon, set up the first wind turbine factory in Brazil in the 1990s and expects to install 22 wind farms totalling 554 MW by the end of 2012.

It has since been followed by Spain's Gamesa, Argentina's Impsa, Germany's Siemens, Denmark's Vestas -- the world biggest wind turbine manufacturer -- GE Wind -- a branch of GE Energy from the United States and India's Suzlon.

The latest to join was French engineering giant Alstom, which last week inaugurated a wind turbine manufacturing plant in the north-eastern state of Bahia, its first in Latin America. The plant, located in the industrial complex of Camacari near Salvador, Bahia's state capital, will serve the domestic and export markets.

Alstom says its ambition is to match its current 40% market share in the Brazilian hydropower plant sector, which is Brazil's main source of electricity generation.

”We won't achieve that tomorrow, but in 10-15 years we can. We are very ambitious in this (wind) sector, not only in Brazil but in the rest of Latin America” said Philippe Delleur, president of Alstom's Brazilian unit.

The greatest potential is in Brazil’s northeast, particularly in the states of Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte and Ceara, due to fast wind speeds and low incidence of tornados or hurricanes. Most of Brazil's wind farms are located on land.]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_17653" align="alignnone" width="300" caption="Ghana&#39;s &#39;Insight&#39; Editor Kwesi Pratt: Incensed about ICC abuses of African Leaders."]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/KWESI-PRATT.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17653" title="KWESI PRATT" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/KWESI-PRATT.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="255" /></a>[/caption]

The Editor of <em>The Insight</em> newspaper, Kwesi Pratt Jnr., is fuming over the appearance of the deposed<strong> Ivorian Leader, Laurent Gbagbo,</strong> at the International Criminal Court.

He told <em>Joy News</em> the principles of justice and fairness demand that ex-US and British leaders, George Bush and Tony Blair respectively, must be hauled before the ICC to account for the millions of massacres they superintended whilst ruling their countries.

Gbagbo is answering charges of crimes against humanity, including murder and rape, after Ivory Coast's disputed presidential elections, a year ago, sparked internal conflict.

But Pratt believes the two former (Western) leaders are worse.

"Many world leaders, including George Bush and Tony Blair, have done far worse than African leaders have done. Within the last ten years, George Bush and Tony Blair and other world leaders have taken actions which have led to the massacre of hundreds of thousands of people; the rape of people. Troops of the US actually roasted Somalis alive on fire and so on. There has been no prosecution.

"So if it's important to prosecute leaders around the world for these acts, then it is important that <strong>every leader who commits such an act</strong> also needs to be brought to book," Pratt stated.

He, like Ghanaian ex-President John Rawlings, wondered why after 50 years of African unity, Africans would hand over their leaders to the ICC to undergo what he referred to as 'humiliation' and to deepen racial prejudice against the African people.

"Why do we think that it is only in The Hague that we can get justice?" Kwesi Pratt asked.

The US does not subject its citizens to any form of prosecution by the ICC and would rather prosecute its citizen accused of any form of human rights violation in the home country.

The Insight Newspaper editor said: "I am wondering why African leaders subscribe to the jurisdiction of the ICC. The US for a long time has refused to subscribe to the jurisdiction of the ICC. So, to some extent, African leaders are blameable for this situation."

Mr Pratt is also shocked that it is only Gbagbo who is before the ICC, when it is on record that the 'New Forces' which brought Allasane Quattara into power (in Côte d'Ivoire) also committed equal or even worse atrocities in the violence that followed the disputed elections.

"How come it is only Gbagbo who is before the ICC?" he quizzed.

He believes the prosecution of Gbagbo at ICC could have dire consequences on the current national reconciliation in Ivory Coast.

<em>In November Bush and Blair were <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629438" target="_blank">found guilty</a> of war crimes by the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629415" target="_blank">Kuala Lumpur International War Crimes Tribunal</a>.</em>]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Quoriana!

I think first of all it's necessary to understand the nature of so-called 'multi-party democracy' here in Ghana.  It bears no resemblance to what we 'northerners' are accustomed to.  It is highly polarized, and people are accustomed to calling each other names and saying nasty things to each other online and off, and they seem not to realize that this is inappropriate behaviour for civilized adults. The young people are as passionate as they are politically ignorant. Televised parliamentary debates are totally chaotic, and in fact this form of government is divisive and toxic to the entire collective psyche of Africans - I think in general.  

This is mostly because it conflicts severely with Traditional African societies and traditions which are Tribal in nature, a bit difficult to understand unless you have lived here for some time.  Newspapers tend to be partisan in viewpoint, and Kwesi Pratt Jr. is a very well-known and outspoken TV/Radio debater and commentator; his newspaper is identified with a more 'socialist' viewpoint which in turn is identified with one particuar party. 

Anybody whose Tribe is identified with supporting a different party will 'hiss and spit' at him given the smallest opportunity, although he is one of the few journalists here who actually insist upon speaking the Truth.  So such comments really need to be ignored, you see, because this bad behaviour is 'normal' to Ghanaians! 

 And you don't even want to hear about the atmosphere here during elections!!! (QQ).  REALLY, the only form of government that makes sense here would be similar to the Libyan Jamahiriya, but getting from here to there remains a heavily-mined 'obstacle course'. 

Ghanaians are proud of the fact that elections have more or less peacefully replaced ruling governments with others of different parties TWICE so far, but the fragility of the process is a constant danger to the society because its very nature is inappropriate.  So my advice is to let them 'fight it out' online - it helps them vent and that may be useful in the short term at least.

Then, of course, there are the 'trolls' and probably the less said about them the better.......

Many thanks for mentioning it, in any case! :)  One does get used to living in the midst of all this eventually. :D  So carry on and as we say in Ghana, "Don't mind them!"

Wassalaams

[caption id="attachment_17658" align="alignnone" width="320" caption="The Real Terrorists."]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The-Real-Terrorists.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17658" title="The Real Terrorists" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The-Real-Terrorists.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="319" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>By Paul Craig Roberts</strong>

In the past decade, Washington has killed, maimed, dislocated, and made widows and orphans millions of Muslims in six countries, all in the name of the “war on terror.” Washington’s attacks on the countries constitute naked aggression and impact primarily civilian populations and infrastructure and, thereby, constitute war crimes under law. Nazis were executed precisely for what Washington is doing today.

Moreover, the wars and military attacks have cost American taxpayers in out-of-pocket and already-incurred future costs at least $4,000 billion dollars – one third of the accumulated public debt – resulting in a US deficit crisis that threatens the social safety net, the value of the US dollar and its reserve currency role, while enriching beyond all previous history the military/security complex and its apologists.

Perhaps the highest cost of Washington’s “war on terror” has been paid by the US Constitution and civil liberties. Any US citizen that Washington accuses is deprived of all legal and constitutional rights. The Bush-Cheney-Obama regimes have overturned humanity’s greatest achievement – the accountability of government to law.

If we look around for the terror that the police state and a decade of war has allegedly protected us from, the terror is hard to find. Except for 9/11 itself, assuming we accept the government’s improbable conspiracy theory explanation, there have been no terror attacks on the US. Indeed,<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://rt.com/usa/news/fbi-terror-report-plot-365-899/"> as RT pointed out on August 23, 2011</a>, an investigative program at the University of California discovered that the domestic “terror plots” hyped in the media were plotted by FBI agents.

FBI undercover agents now number 15,000, ten times their number during the protests against the Vietnam war when protesters were suspected of communist sympathies. As there apparently are no real terror plots for this huge workforce to uncover, the FBI justifies its budget, terror alerts, and invasive searches of American citizens by thinking up “terror plots” and finding some deranged individuals to ensnare. For example, the Washington DC Metro bombing plot, the New York city subway plot, the plot to blow up the Sears Tower in Chicago were all FBI brainchilds organized and managed by FBI agents.

RT reports that only three plots might have been independent of the FBI, but as none of the three worked they obviously were not the work of such a professional terror organization as Al Qaeda is purported to be. The Times Square car bomb didn’t blow up, and apparently could not have.

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-09-28/DC-terrorist-plot-drone/50593792/1">The latest FBI sting ensnared a Boston man</a>, Rezwan Ferdaus, who is accused of planning to attack the Pentagon and US Capitol with model airplanes packed with C-4 explosives. US Attorney Carmen Ortiz assured Americans that they were never in danger, because the FBI’s undercover agents were in control of the plot.

Ferdaus’ FBI-organized plot to blow up the Pentagon and US Capitol with model airplanes has produced charges that he provided “material support to a terrorist organization” and plotted to destroy federal buildings – the most serious charge which carries 20 imprisoned years for each targeted building.

What is the terrorist organization that Ferdaus is serving? Surely not al Qaeda, which allegedly outwitted all 16 US intelligence services, all intelligence services of America’s NATO and Israeli allies, NORAD, the National Security Council, Air Traffic Control, Dick Cheney, and US airport security four times in one hour on the same morning. Such a highly capable terror organization would not be involved in such nonsense as a plot to blow up the Pentagon with a model airplane.

As an American who was in public service for a number of years and who has always stood up for the Constitution, a patriot’s duty, I must hope that the question has already popped into readers’ minds why we are expected to believe that a tiny model airplane is capable of blowing up the Pentagon when a 757 airliner loaded with jet fuel was incapable of doing the job, merely making a hole not big enough for an airliner.

When I observe the gullibility of my fellow citizens at the absurd “terror plots” that the US government manufactures, it causes me to realize that fear is the most powerful weapon any government has for advancing an undeclared agenda. If Ferdaus is brought to trial, no doubt a jury will convict him of a plot to blow up the Pentagon and US Capitol with model airplanes. Most likely he will be tortured or coerced into a plea bargain.

Apparently, Americans, or most of them, are so ruled by fear that they suffer no remorse from “their” government’s murder and dislocation of millions of innocent people. In the American mind, one billion “towel-heads” have been reduced to terrorists who deserve to be exterminated. The US is on its way to a holocaust that makes the terrors Jews faced from National Socialism into a mere precursor.

Think about this: Are not you amazed that after a decade (2.5 times the length of WW II) of killing Muslims and destroying families and their prospects in six countries there are no real terrorist events in the US?

Think for a minute how easy terrorism would be in the US if there were any terrorists. Would an Al Qaeda terrorist from the organization that allegedly pulled off 9/11 – the most humiliating defeat ever suffered by a Western power, much less “the world’s only superpower” – still in the face of all the screening be trying to hijack an airliner or to blow one up?

Surely not when there are so many totally soft targets. If America were really infected with a “terrorist threat,” a terrorist would merely get in the massive lines awaiting to clear airport “security” and set off his bomb. It would kill far more people than could be achieved by blowing up an airliner, and it would make it completely clear that “airport security” meant no one was safe.

It would be child’s pay for terrorists to blow up electric substations as no one is there, nothing but a chain link fence. It would be easy for terrorists to blow up shopping centers. It would be easy for terrorists to dump boxes of roofing nails on congested streets and freeways during rush hours, tying up main transportation arteries for days.

Before, Dear Reader, you accuse me of giving terrorists ideas, do you really think that these ideas would not already have occurred to terrorists capable of pulling off 9/11?

But nothing happens. So the FBI arrests a guy for planning to blow up America with a model airplane. It is really depressing how many Americans will believe this.

Consider also that American neoconservatives, who have orchestrated the “war on terror,” have no protection whatsoever and that the Secret Service protection of Bush and Cheney is minimal. If America really faced a terrorist threat, especially one so professional to have brought off 9/11, every neoconservative along with Bush and Cheney could be assassinated within one hour on one morning or one evening.

The fact that neoconservatives such as Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld, Condi Rice, Richard Perle, Douglas Feith, John Bolton, William Kristol, Libby, Addington, et. al., live unprotected and free of fear is proof that America faces no terrorist threat.

Think now about the airliner shoe-bomb plot, the shampoo-bottled water plot, and the underwear-bomb plot. Experts, other than the whores hired by the US government, say that these plots are nonsensical. The “shoe bomb” and “underwear bomb” were colored fireworks powders incapable of blowing up a tin can. The liquid bomb, allegedly mixed up in an airliner toilet room, has been dismissed by experts as fantasy.

What is the purpose of these fake plots? And remember, all reports confirm that the “underwear bomber” was walked onto the airliner by an official, despite the fact that the “underwear bomber” had no passport. No investigation was ever conducted by the FBI, CIA, or anyone into why a passenger without a passport was allowed on an international flight.

The purpose of these make-believe plots is to raise the fear level and to create the opportunity for former Homeland Security czar Michael Chertoff to make a fortune selling porno-scanners to the TSA.

The result of these hyped “terrorist plots” is that every American citizen, even those with high government positions and security clearances, cannot board a commercial airline flight without taking off his shoes, his jacket, his belt, submitting to a porno-scanner, or being sexually groped. Nothing could make it plainer that “airport security” cannot tell a Muslim terrorist from a gung-ho American patriot, a US Senator, a US Marine general, or a CIA operative.

If a passenger requires for health or other reasons quantities of liquids and cremes beyond the limits imposed on toothpaste, shampoo, food, or medications, the passenger must obtain prior approval from TSA, which seldom works. One of America’s finest moments is the case, documented on YouTube, of a dying woman in a wheelchair, who requires special food, having her food thrown away by the Gestapo TSA despite the written approval from the Transportation Safety Administration, her daughter arrested for protesting, and the dying woman in the wheelchair left alone in the airport.

This is Amerika today. These assaults on innocent citizens are justified by the mindless right-wing as “protecting us against terrorism,” a “threat” that all evidence shows is non-existent.

No American is secure today. I am a former staff associate of the House Defense Appropriations sub-committee. I required high security clearances as I had access to information pertaining to all US weapons programs. As Chief Economist of the House Budget Committee, I had information pertaining to the US military and security budgets. As Assistant Secretary of the US Treasury, I was provided every morning with the CIA’s briefing of the President as well as with endless security information.

When I left the Treasury, President Reagan appointed me to a super-secret committee to investigate the CIA’s assessment of Soviet capability. Afterwards I was a consultant to the Pentagon. I had every kind of security clearance.

Despite my record of highest security clearances and US government confidence in me, including confirmation by the US Senate in a presidential appointment, the airline police cannot tell me from a terrorist.

If I were into model airplanes or attending antiwar demonstrations, little doubt I, too, would be arrested.

After my public service in the last quarter of the 20th century, I experienced during the first decade of the 21st century all of America’s achievements, despite their blemishes, being erased. In their place was erected a monstrous desire for hegemony and highly concentrated wealth. Most of my friends and my fellow citizens, in general, are incapable of recognizing America’s transformation into a warmonger police state that has the worst income distribution of any developed country.

It is extraordinary that so many Americans, citizens of the world’s only superpower, actually believe that they are threatened by Muslim peoples who have no unity, no navy, no air force, no nuclear weapons, no missiles capable of reaching across the oceans.

Indeed, large percentages of these “threat populations,” especially among the young, are enamored of the sexual freedom that exists in America. Even the Iranian dupes of the CIA-orchestrated “Green Revolution” have forgotten Washington’s overthrow of their elected government in the 1950s. Despite America’s decade-long abusive military actions against Muslim peoples, many Muslims still look to America for their salvation.

Their “leaders” are simply bought off with large sums of money.

With the “terrorist threat” and Al Qaeda deflated with President Obama’s alleged assassination of its leader, Osama bin Laden, who was left unprotected and unarmed by his “worldwide terrorist organization,” Washington has come up with a new bogeyman – the Haqqanis.

John Glaser reports that, according to anonymous CIA officials, US Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Mike Mullen, “exaggerated” the case against the Haqqani insurgent group when he claimed, setting up a US invasion of Pakistan, that the Haqqanis were an operating arm of the Pakistan government’s secret service, the ISI. Adm. Mullen is now running from his “exaggeration,” an euphemism for a lie. His aide, Captain John Kirby, said that Mullen’s “accusations were designed to influence the Pakistanis to crack down on the Haqqani Network.” In other words, the Pakistanis should kill more of their own people to save the Americans the trouble.

If you don’t know what the Haqqani Network is, don’t be surprised. You never heard of Al Qaeda prior to 9/11. The US government creates whatever new bogeymen and incidents are necessary to further the neoconservative agenda of world hegemony and higher profits for the armaments industry.

For ten years, the “superpower” American population has sat there, being terrified by the government’s lies. While Americans sit in fear of non-existent “terrorists” sucking their thumbs, millions of people in six countries have had their lives destroyed. As far as any evidence exists, the vast majority of Americans are unperturbed by the wanton murder of others in countries that they are incapable of locating on maps.

Truly, Amerika is a light unto the world, an example for all.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/david_cameron-500x370.jpg" alt="" title="david_cameron" width="500" height="370" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17695" />
<em>This time David Cameron stands alone against the fiendish Goliath of the European Union.</em>

<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

For once, I find myself on the same side as David Cameron, the David who stands alone against the fiendish Goliath of the European Union, that all-engulfing rampaging monster which gobbles up national identities, disregarding its citizens as it makes sweeping decisions over their heads, sending the lemmings scurrying over the cliff-edge…

I could not have disagreed more with David Cameron over his policy in Libya, as indeed I have disagreed with Britain’s jingoistic and arrogant foreign policy for as long as I can remember – the last five Prime Ministers have been involved in nine wars, sowing the seeds of hatred for years to come, as the Foreign Office believes it is a sort of external Department of Trade and Industry and sees military campaigns as good business.

The bottom line cementing where I agree with David Cameron on the first point and disagree on the second is based upon the notion of sovereignty in a globalised world.

<strong>Globalisation, sovereignty and federalism</strong>

Those of us who dreamed of a global nation of brothers and sisters living along the shores of our common lake – the seas – helping one another more through altruism than self-interest, have been brought tumbling to Earth time and time again as collectively, a great number of nations, usually centred around NATO, egged on by the nonchalance or disinterest of the rest of the international community, committed outrages against international law, human rights and common decency.

Those who had hoped that globalisation of economies would walk hand-in-hand with a new globalised spirit of common values, common practices of goodwill and a new spirit of fraternal relations, looked on aghast as the world community proved incapable of solving the Middle East crisis (basically through an absence of will fuelled by interests and lobbying) and as NATO swung into action against Serbia, supporting Albanian terrorists, then Afghanistan (and no, the real reason was not 9/11 but that is a long story), then Iraq and now Libya. The sovereignty of these nations was disrespected, flouting the terms of the UN Charter, UNSC resolutions and violating the norms of all diplomatic agreements since Westphalia (1648) and in the unilateral creation of “Kosovo”, the countries jumping on the bandwagon disregarded their obligations under the Helsinki Final Act (1975).

This Act was signed by the USA, Canada and all European States with the exception of Albania and Andorra and its underlying principle was the recognition of existing frontiers, the laying down of guidelines for sovereignty and the inviolability of this precept. While the foreign policy of David Cameron’s United Kingdom has violated this principle, along with its NATO bed pals in recent decades (and we ask, how Constitutional is NATO in its Member States, for where in any Constitution can the conduct of a State’s foreign policy be handed over to external parties?), his courageous stance on Europe is commendable.

Only yesterday, as I called him a “spineless jellyfish” I was hoping that he would prove me wrong, and I am very happy to say that he has. The question as to whether it was a strategic or a political one, pandering more to the needs to hold together his own party after a substantial number of Tory backbenchers started showing signs of revolt, is irrelevant.

The point is that David Cameron’s stance is one in favour of sovereignty and the European Union’s is not. And what happened this Thursday and Friday in Brussels is worthy of note: one nation stood up to the Euro-monster, which dictates your internal policy to you, controlling your finances, controlling your fiscal policy, controlling your national interests and imposing sanctions when national policy fails to implement the Grand Plan. David Cameron’s position is one of Sovereignty versus Federalism.

It makes sense to form a Federation out of States certainly with a common identity, probably with common values, maybe not common cultures. How, then, do you form a Federation out of the Tower of Babel which is the European Union? Compare the USA, the Russian Federation, the Federal States of Micronesia and Brazil with the European Union and you will see that where it makes sense with the former, it certainly does not in the case of the latter.

The last five thousand years of history have taught Europe to stand together through Treaties of friendship and cooperation, which is largely what existed with EFTA and with the beginning of the Common Market but which has been overtaken by a fast-lane occupied by budding Eurocrats who have tried to go too far and too fast. What happens to those who drive too fast and do not pay attention to where they are going?

Twenty-six nations, joined by Sweden, Hungary and the Czech Republic, countries which had initially stood alongside Britain but which buckled spectacularly under the pressure at the last minute, will now try to get out the hole they have dug for themselves by digging themselves further in. They will not ask their citizens whether they want to have their sovereignty taken further away from them, they will just plough ahead and guess who will pay for the consequences of their actions?

David Cameron can sleep well tonight knowing he stepped out of the hole at the right moment and knowing that the UK is the one country in the European Union that can use leverage mechanisms which its partners have signed away. David Cameron knows that he has an Atlantic trading triangle to exploit with the USA and Canada, and the UK has the Commonwealth which it turned its back upon partially when it joined the EU. David Cameron has defended his country’s sovereignty, the UK has options.

And therefore those thirty kilometres of Channel which separate the British Isles from France may just be enough for the EU not to constitute a stone around Britain’s neck when it sinks. When it does, the citizens of the EU will look to their leaders and ask them why they did not act like David Cameron. 26 against 1 does not necessarily mean that the 26 are right.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Nkrumahism and the Jamahiriya will come back to power in Africa.</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/panio/" target="_blank">PANIO</a></strong> <strong></strong>
<strong>(<em>US/NATO Hands Off Libya! Hands Off Africa! Coalition</em>)</strong>

Honouring the legacy of Kwame Nkrumah and Muammar Al Qathafi means that Africans throughout Africa and the world must organize themselves so as to continue the struggle to defeat U.S., British, and French imperialism in Africa. These imperialist nations have been enemies of Africa from their initial contact with the continent 500 years ago during the slave raid. Britain and France held over 90% of the colonies in Africa, and the U.S. is the foremost neo-colonialist entity in Africa today. They were and are the main factors in the counter-revolution in Ghana that overthrew Kwame Nkrumah, and are the culprits in the assassination of Muammar Al Qathafi in the unjust illegal war waged against Libya.

<strong>Nkrumah and Qathafi legacy will unify Africa!</strong>

Both Nkrumah's and Qathafi's contributions to Pan-Africanism (the total freedom and liberation of Africa under an All African Union Socialist Government) are outstanding! Pan-Africanism is going to take all African people out of poverty, destroy neo-colonialism, and provide the conditions for the working African masses to take control of their resources (oil, gold, gas, diamonds, platinum, bauxite, uranium, manganese, timber etc.) to create industries for manufacturing finished products to develop Africa into an economic powerhouse under Socialism.

Kwame Nkrumah was a socialist with an independent philosophy and ideology (Philosophical Consciencism and Nkrumahism) who spearheaded the creation of the Organization of African Unity in 1963, but was undermined by European imperialism and prevented by two votes from uniting Africa in 1965 in an OAU meeting held in Accra, Ghana. Muammar Al Qathafi was a socialist with an independent ideology (<a href="http://mathaba.net/gci/theory.htm" target="_blank">Third Universal Theory</a>) who spearheaded the change of the OAU to the African Union (AU) in 2002, moving the organization closer to an All African Union Government in 2005 (which was called for by Kwame Nkrumah). Qathafi was prevented by European imperialism, because of the illegal war waged on Libya, from installing in September 2011 a banking system for Africa through the auspices of the AU; the African Monetary Fund, African Investment Bank, and an African Central Bank. This would have freed African leadership from financial control of the U.S., Britain and France dominated International Monetary Fund and World Bank. This would have defeated neo-colonialism by eliminating Africa’s indebtedness and laid the basis for an All African Union Government.

Kwame Nkrumah supported revolutionary African governments (Democratic Party of Guinea) and liberation movements throughout Africa, and waged an intense fight against settler colonial states in line with President Robert Mugabe and the Zimbabwe African National Union, while facilitating their revolutionary action through All African People’s Conferences and Conferences of Independent African States to unify Africa. Muammar Al-Qathafi supported the African National Congress (ANC) to fight against the racist apartheid settler colonial state of South Africa, helped to bring them to political power and revolutionized the entire communications network of Africa by providing $300 million to put a satellite in space, giving Africa an independent voice of unity without going through Europe.

Kwame Nkrumah called for an All African High Command to unite the military leadership of all African armies, and Muammar Al-Qathafi was organizing to bring into  existence a 3-million-man continental army. Kwame Nkrumah called for one African currency and a common market for Africa, and in September 2011 Qathafi would have begun the process of instituting a single currency backed by Africa’s gold. With Ghana and South Africa being the largest gold producers in the world it would have demolished the collapsing Euro-zone $49trillion indebted nations of Europe and the U.S. currencies, and severed the ties of dependency on the rotten economic system of European-imposed neo-colonialism in Africa.

<strong>Maintaining Africa's ideological independence
</strong>

In order to instill independence of thought by creating an ideology that derived from African history and culture to bring about a socialist state, Kwame Nkrumah wrote a book, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/gohttp://www.africawithin.com/nkrumah/consciencism.htm">Consciencism</a>, and Muammar Al Qathafi also wrote the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theory/gb.htm" target="_blank">Green Book</a> for the same purposes to build a socialist state. To facilitate the independent ideology, Nkrumahism, Kwame Nkrumah organized a mass political party (Convention People’s Party) which won as the National party of Ghana with 88% of the vote in 1960. The CPP was able to provide free education, free health care, have no unemployment, control over 70% of Ghana’s resources and maintain the highest living standard on the African continent in 1966. Muammar Al Qathafi organized the Jamahiriya (Authority of the Masses) with an independent ideology, The <a href="http://mathaba.net/gci/theory.htm" target="_blank">Third Universal Theory</a>, into <a href="http://peoplesconference.org/pc/" target="_blank">People’s Congresses and People’s Committees</a> that provided free housing, free water, free electricity, free medical care, free education, $50,000 for each married couple to start their married life; farmers received a free house, livestock, seed, and farming equipment for free, and by controlling 90% of the oil wealth Libyans had the highest standard of living on the African continent in 2011. Qathafi is the only leader in the history of humanity that dug deep beneath the Sahara Desert and created a river to provide free water for all Libyans.

During the counter-revolution against Nkrumah’s government, Africans that were Pan-Africanist and born in the U.S. and outside of Ghana, were dismissed by the National Liberation Council on orders from the U.S. embassy and made to leave the country; training camps of freedom fighters from all over Africa were broken up—disrupting the coordination of the African revolution (reference <em>Dark Days in Ghana </em>by Kwame Nkrumah). Under Qathafi tens of thousands of black Africans from all over Africa were rooted in Libya. They were thriving in the Jamahiriya system earning enough money to take care of their families in their respective countries, strengthening the bonds of African unity and providing an exemplary example of a socialist society. The National Transitional Council (NTC)'s Al-Qaeda CIA-trained terrorist mercenaries, at the behest of U.S. NATO (still bombing) are murdering and raping black Africans, including black Libyans, causing tens of thousands of Africans to leave Libya. In each instance, Libya and Ghana, the ideological centres (at Sirte and Winneba) that trained Africans in independence of thought were targeted first, attacked and destroyed.

<strong>Nkrumahism and the Jamahiriya will come back to power in Africa</strong>

The U.S.-NATO-European military imperialist forces aim was not only to attack the ability of Africans to think independent ideologically, they also started the war by using the NTC Al-Qaeda CIA-trained terrorist mercenaries to overthrow the Jamahiriya to take the country’s oil. This is forcing their puppets to take loans so as to impose dependency with a neo-colonial ideology and economic structure. This was the same aim of the British, French, and U.S. intelligence agencies that paid reactionary elements in Ghana’s police and military to overthrow Kwame Nkrumah and the CPP government, which has the Ghanaian masses suffering today in poverty as a HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Country) in debt to European imperialism with European capitalists in control of 90% of Ghana’s oil and gold, thus placing the country under neo-colonialism and agreeing to an occupying force of U.S. troops at Ghana’s air force base. In contrast, under Qathafi and the Jamahiriya, Libya had no debt, and there were no foreign troops on Libya’s soil. This illustrates how the working masses of Ghana and Libya's struggles are identical in taking control of their resources and fighting against U.S. NATO neo-colonialist occupation forces.

The attacks waged by U.S. and European imperialist forces against Nkrumah and Qathafi are a testimony of their dedication to the freedom of Africa and justice for the African masses. Qathafi and the Jamahiriya have been fighting U.S. NATO forces for 9 months (the combined power of the U.S. and Europe’s military) the most powerful military technologically in the history of humanity, representing 700 million people, while Libya comprises only 6 million people. No other African country has fought this long against such a force , which infers that if Africa unites we can defeat U.S. and European imperialism in a matter of days!

As a consequence of this resilience of the Libyan masses, Qathafi’s and Nkrumah’s deaths should not be in vain, nor should the deaths of Ghanaians and Libyans and their sacrifice go without retaliation. The U.S. NATO Hands Off Libya! Hands Off Africa! Coalition is calling all progressive and revolutionary organizations to join our coalition, and Africans in general to join an organization to defeat U.S. NATO imperialist invasion in Africa; defeat neo-colonialism in Africa and fight for an All African Union Socialist Government so as to bring the Jamahiriya back to power in Libya and enthrone Nkrumahism in Ghana. This is the only way we can truly honour the legacy of Kwame Nkrumah and Muammar Al Qathafi.

<strong>Victory to the Jamahiriya!</strong>

<strong>Defeat U.S. NATO imperialist military invasion in Libya and Africa!</strong>

[caption id="attachment_17684" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="The two leaders &#39;pecking&#39; according to the Venezuelan leader."]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CHAVEZ-AND-OBAMA.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17684" title="CHAVEZ AND OBAMA" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CHAVEZ-AND-OBAMA.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="353" /></a>[/caption]

<em>Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez laughed off a Benetton advertisement that showed him kissing his ideological adversary and US counterpart Barack Obama, admitting that it was a “good joke.”</em>

The photo was part of a controversial campaign by the Italian fashion company that showed political and religious leaders kissing each other on the mouth.

The Vatican said it would take legal action over one image of Pope Benedict kissing a Muslim imam. But Chávez on Tuesday took it in better humour.

“I hadn't seen this! How does Obama look there? With his eyes closed! Like he's inspired!” Chávez joked when asked by reporters about the picture of him and the US leader.

”But it's just a peck, really, only a peck. They mess with me all the time, but I don't do anything ... my personal and spiritual tendency is to laugh at myself. It was a good joke.“

Benetton said the purpose of its campaign had been ”exclusively to fight the culture of hate in every form“ but that it nonetheless decided to withdraw the image of the Pope.

Chávez joked that he expected something from the company for being a good sport about the latest campaign.

”They're not even going to send me a tie? I hope for a tie for Christmas“ the populist leader said. ”It's a publicity strategy ... I commend their creativity.”

		<title>Iranian lawmaker: Iran has means to decrypt drone data</title>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17784" title="iranian-lawmaker" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iranian-lawmaker.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" />
<em>Lawmaker Seyed Hossein Naqavi Hosseini says decoding the US drone's data will provide Iran's armed forces with very important information.</em>

A senior Iranian lawmaker says Iran owns the “ultra-advanced technology” which enables it to decode the captured US drone's data and documents.

Member of the Majlis (parliament) National Security and Foreign Policy Committee Seyyed Hossein Naqavi Hosseini said on Saturday that the Americans are seriously concerned about the documents the drone was carrying, Fars News Agency reported.

“However, they should know that the Islamic Republic of Iran will 'decode' the American drone's documents and data with the 'ultra-advanced technology' that it has,” he added.

The lawmaker said decoding the US drone's data will provide Iran's armed forces with very important information.

On Sunday December 4, the Iranian Army's electronic warfare unit downed, with minimum damage, the US RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft which was flying over the Iranian city of Kashmar, some 140 miles (225km) from the Afghan border. The RQU-170 crossed into Iran's airspace over the border with neighboring Afghanistan earlier this week.

Naqavi further said the unmanned aerial vehicles operate via a remote navigation system and “therefore, if a country has the technology to remotely control the drones, it can put spy drones on any course it wants.”

The lawmaker stated that RQ-170 spy drones have a complicated mechanism and ultra-advanced electronic technology and are, in fact, the symbol of superior US technology.

“When such a drone with all this technology…is hunted by the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, it proves Iran's high [level of] defense technology in defending its airspace,” he said.

Iran has announced that it intends to carry out reverse engineering on the captured RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft, which is similar in design to a US Air Force B-2 stealth bomber.

The RQ-170 is an unmanned stealth aircraft designed and developed by the Lockheed Martin Company.]]></content:encoded>

<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/RIBEIRO.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17706" title="RIBEIRO" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/RIBEIRO-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" /></a>
<em>Não, não era uma invenção ou uma desculpa esfarrapada. O jornalista Amaury Ribeiro Jr. realmente preparava um livro sobre as falcatruas das privatizações do governo FHC.</em>

Neste fim de semana chega às livrarias “A Privataria Tucana”, resultado de 12 anos de trabalho  do premiado repórter que durante a campanha eleitoral do ano passado foi acusado de participar de um grupo cujo objetivo era quebrar o sigilo fiscal e bancário de políticos tucanos. Ribeiro Jr. acabou indiciado pela Polícia Federal e tornou-se involuntariamente personagem da disputa presidencial. Na edição que chega às bancas nesta sexta-feira 9, CartaCapital traz um relato exclusivo e minucioso do conteúdo do livro de 343 publicado pela Geração Editorial e uma entrevista com autor (reproduzida abaixo).

A obra apresenta documentos inéditos de lavagem de dinheiro e pagamento de propina, todos recolhidos em fontes públicas, entre elas os arquivos da CPI do Banestado.

José Serra é o personagem central dessa história. Amigos e parentes do ex-governador paulista operaram um complexo sistema de maracutaias financeiras que prosperou no auge do processo de privatização.

Ribeiro Jr. elenca uma série de personagens envolvidas com a “privataria” dos anos 1990, todos ligados a Serra, aí incluídos a filha, Verônica Serra, o genro, Alexandre Bourgeois, e um sócio e marido de uma prima, Gregório Marín Preciado.

Mas quem brilha mesmo é o ex-diretor da área internacional do Banco do Brasil, o economista Ricardo Sérgio de Oliveira. Ex-tesoureiro de Serra e FHC, Oliveira, ou Mister Big, é o cérebro por trás da complexa engenharia de contas, doleiros e offshores criadas em paraísos fiscais para esconder os recursos desviados da privatização.

O livro traz, por exemplo, documentos nunca antes revelados que provam depósitos de uma empresa de Carlos Jereissati, participante do consórcio que arrematou a Tele Norte Leste, antiga Telemar, hoje OI, na conta de uma companhia de Oliveira nas Ilhas Virgens Britânicas. Também revela que Preciado movimentou 2,5 bilhões de dólares por meio de outra conta do mesmo Oliveira. Segundo o livro, o ex-tesoureiro de Serra tirou ou internou  no Brasil, em seu nome, cerca de 20 milhões de dólares em três anos.

A Decidir.com, sociedade de Verônica Serra e Verônica Dantas, irmã do banqueiro Daniel Dantas, também se valeu do esquema. Outra revelação: a filha do ex-governador acabou indiciada pela Polícia Federal por causa da quebra de sigilo de 60 milhões de brasileiros. Por meio de um contrato da Decidir com o Banco do Brasil, cuja existência foi revelada por CartaCapital em 2010, Verônica teve acesso de forma ilegal a cadastros bancários e fiscais em poder da instituição financeira.

Na entrevista a seguir, Ribeiro Jr. explica como reuniu os documentos para produzir o livro, refaz o caminho das disputas no PSDB e no PT que o colocaram no centro da campanha eleitoral de 2010 e afirma: “Serra sempre teve medo do que seria publicado no livro”.

<strong>CartaCapital:</strong> Por que você decidiu investigar o processo de privatização no governo Fernando Henrique Cardoso?

<strong>Amaury Ribeiro Jr.:</strong> Em 2000, quando eu era repórter de O Globo, tomei gosto pelo tema. Antes, minha área da atuação era a de reportagens sobre direitos humanos e crimes da ditadura militar. Mas, no início do século, começaram a estourar os escândalos a envolver Ricardo Sérgio de Oliveira (ex-tesoureiro de campanha do PSDB e ex-diretor do Banco do Brasil). Então, comecei a investigar essa coisa de lavagem de dinheiro. Nunca mais abandonei esse tema. Minha vida profissional passou a ser sinônimo disso.

<strong>CC:</strong> Quem lhe pediu para investigar o envolvimento de José Serra nesse esquema de lavagem de dinheiro?

<strong>ARJ:</strong> Quando comecei, não tinha esse foco. Em 2007, depois de ter sido baleado em Brasília, voltei a trabalhar em Belo Horizonte, como repórter do Estado de Minas. Então, me pediram para investigar como Serra estava colocando espiões para bisbilhotar Aécio Neves, que era o governador do estado. Era uma informação que vinha de cima, do governo de Minas. Hoje, sabemos que isso era feito por uma empresa (a Fence, contratada por Serra), conforme eu explico no livro, que traz documentação mostrando que foi usado dinheiro público para isso.

<strong>CC:</strong> Ficou surpreso com o resultado da investigação?

<strong>ARJ:</strong> A apuração demonstrou aquilo que todo mundo sempre soube que Serra fazia. Na verdade, são duas coisas que o PSDB sempre fez: investigação dos adversários e esquemas de contrainformação. Isso ficou bem evidenciado em muitas ocasiões, como no caso da Lunus (que derrubou a candidatura de Roseana Sarney, então do PFL, em 2002) e o núcleo de inteligência da Anvisa (montado por Serra no Ministério da Saúde), com os personagens de sempre, Marcelo Itagiba (ex-delegado da PF e ex-deputado federal tucano) à frente. Uma coisa que não está no livro é que esse mesmo pessoal trabalhou na campanha de Fernando Henrique Cardoso, em 1994, mas sob o comando de um jornalista de Brasília, Mino Pedrosa. Era uma turma que tinha também Dadá (Idalísio dos Santos, araponga da Aeronáutica) e Onézimo Souza (ex-delegado da PF).

<strong>CC:</strong> O que você foi fazer na campanha de Dilma Rousseff, em 2010?

<strong>ARJ:</strong> Um amigo, o jornalista Luiz Lanzetta, era o responsável pela assessoria de imprensa da campanha da Dilma. Ele me chamou porque estava preocupado com o vazamento geral de informações na casa onde se discutia a estratégia de campanha do PT, no Lago Sul de Brasília. Parecia claro que o pessoal do PSDB havia colocado gente para roubar informações. Mesmo em reuniões onde só estavam duas ou três pessoas, tudo aparecia na mídia no dia seguinte. Era uma situação totalmente complicada.

<strong>CC:</strong> Você foi chamado para acabar com os vazamentos?

<strong>ARJ:</strong> Eu fui chamado para dar uma orientação sobre o que fazer, intermediar um contrato com gente capaz de resolver o problema, o que acabou não acontecendo. Eu busquei ajuda com o Dadá, que me trouxe, em seguida, o ex-delegado Onézimo Souza. Não tinha nada de grampear ou investigar a vida de outros candidatos. Esse “núcleo de inteligência” que até Prêmio Esso deu nunca existiu, é uma mentira deliberada. Houve uma única reunião para se discutir o assunto, no restaurante Fritz (na Asa Sul de Brasília), mas logo depois eu percebi que tinha caído numa armadilha.

<strong>CC:</strong> Mas o que, exatamente, vocês pensavam em fazer com relação aos vazamentos?

<strong>ARJ:</strong> Havia dentro do grupo de Serra um agente da Abin (Agência Brasileira de Inteligência) que tinha se desentendido com Marcelo Itagiba. O nome dele é Luiz Fernando Barcellos, conhecido na comunidade de informações como “agente Jardim”. A gente pensou em usá-lo como infiltrado, dentro do esquema de Serra, para chegar a quem, na campanha de Dilma, estava vazando informações. Mas essa ideia nunca foi posta em prática.

<strong>CC:</strong> Você é o responsável pela quebra de sigilo de tucanos e da filha de Serra, Verônica, na agência da Receita Federal de Mauá?

<strong>ARJ:</strong> Aquilo foi uma armação, pagaram para um despachante para me incriminar. Não conheço ninguém em Mauá, nunca estive lá. Aquilo faz parte do conhecido esquema de contrainformação, uma especialidade do PSDB.

<strong>CC:</strong> E por que o PSDB teria interesse em incriminá-lo?

<strong>ARJ:</strong> Ficou bem claro durante as eleições passadas que Serra tinha medo de esse meu livro vir à tona. Quando se descobriu o que eu tinha em mãos, uma fonte do PSDB veio me contar que Serra ficou atormentado, começou a tratar mal todo mundo, até jornalistas que o apoiavam. Entrou em pânico. Aí partiram para cima de mim, primeiro com a história de Eduardo Jorge Caldeira (vice-presidente do PSDB), depois, da filha do Serra, o que é uma piada, porque ela já estava incriminada, justamente por crime de quebra de sigilo. Eu acho, inclusive, que Eduardo Jorge estimulou essa coisa porque, no fundo, queria apavorar Serra. Ele nunca perdoou Serra por ter sido colocado de lado na campanha de 2010.

<strong>CC:</strong> Mas o fato é que José Serra conseguiu que sua matéria não fosse publicada no Estado de Minas.

<strong>ARJ:</strong> É verdade, a matéria não saiu. Ele ligou para o próprio Aécio para intervir no Estado de Minas e, de quebra, conseguiu um convite para ir à festa de 80 anos do jornal. Nenhuma novidade, porque todo mundo sabe que Serra tem mania de interferir em redações, que é um cara vingativo.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By Ellen Brown</strong>

"To some people, the European Central Bank seems like a fire department that is letting the house burn down to teach the children not to play with matches."

So <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/global/as-crisis-deepens-ecb-stands-firm.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">wrote</a> Jack Ewing in the New York Times last week. He went on:

"The E.C.B. has a fire hose — its ability to print money. But the bank is refusing to train it on the euro zone’s debt crisis."

"The flames climbed higher Friday after the Italian Treasury had to pay an interest rate of 6.5 percent on a new issue of six-month bills . . . the highest interest rate Italy has had to pay to sell such debt since August 1997 . . . "

"But there is no sign the E.C.B. plans a major response, like buying large quantities of the country’s bonds to bring down its borrowing costs."

Why not? <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203802204577064573943069702.html" target="_blank">According to the November 28<sup>th</sup> Wall Street Journal</a>, "The ECB has long worried that buying government bonds in big enough amounts to bring down countries' borrowing costs would make it easier for national politicians to delay the budget austerity and economic overhauls that are needed."

As with the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.webofdebt.com/articles/forget_compromise.php" target="_blank">manufactured debt ceiling crisis</a> in the United States, the E.C.B. is withholding relief in order to extort austerity measures from member governments—and the threat seems to be working. The same authors write:

"Euro-zone leaders are negotiating a potentially groundbreaking fiscal pact . . . [that] would make budget discipline legally binding and enforceable by European authorities. . .  European officials hope a new agreement, which would aim to shrink the excessive public debt that helped spark the crisis, would persuade the European Central Bank to undertake more drastic action to reverse the recent selloff in euro-zone debt markets."

The Eurozone appears to be in the process of being "structurally readjusted" – the same process imposed earlier by the IMF on Third World countries. Structural demands routinely include harsh austerity measures, government cutbacks, privatization, and the disempowerment of national central banks, so that there is no national entity capable of creating and controlling the money supply on behalf of the people.  The latter result has officially been achieved in the Eurozone, which is now dependent on the E.C.B. as the sole lender of last resort and printer of new euros.

<strong>The E.C.B. Serves Banks, Not Governments</strong>

The legal justification for the E.C.B.’s inaction in the sovereign debt crisis is <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-the-functioning-of-the-european-union-and-comments/part-3-union-policies-and-internal-actions/title-viii-economic-and-monetary-policy/chapter-1-economic-policy/391-article-123.html" target="_blank">Article 123</a> of the Lisbon Treaty, signed by EU members in 2007.  As Jens Eidmann, President of the Bundesbank and a member of the E.C.B. Governing Council, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.lacarpetanegra.com/blog/2011/11/15/article-123-of-the-lisbon-treaty-is-quite-clear/" target="_blank">stated</a> in a November 14 interview:

"The eurosystem is a lender of last resort for solvent but illiquid banks. It must not be a lender of last resort for sovereigns because this would violate Article 123 of the EU treaty."

The language of Article 123 is rather obscure, but basically it says that the European central bank is the lender of last resort for banks, not for governments. It provides:

"1. Overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the European Central Bank or with the central banks of the Member States (hereinafter referred to as 'national central banks') in favour of Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments, regional, local or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of Member States shall be prohibited, as shall the purchase directly from them by the European Central Bank or national central banks of debt instruments.

2.  Paragraph 1 shall not apply to publicly owned credit institutions which, in the context of the supply of reserves by central banks, shall be given the same treatment by national central banks and the European Central Bank as private credit institutions."

Banks can borrow from the E.C.B. at 1.25%, the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.euribor-rates.eu/ecb-refinancing-rate.asp" target="_blank">minimum rate</a> available for banks.  Member governments, on the other hand, must put themselves at the mercy of the markets, which can squeeze them for "whatever the market will bear"—in Italy's case, 6.5%.

<strong> The Real Reason Eurozone Countries Are Drowning in Debt</strong>

Why should banks be able to borrow at 1.25% from the E.C.B.’s unlimited fountain of euros, while the tap is closed for governments? The conventional argument is that for governments to borrow money created by their own central banks would be "inflationary." But private banks create the money they lend just as government-owned central banks do.  Private banks issue money in the form of "bank credit" on their books, and they often do this <em>before</em> they have the liquidity to back the loans.  Then they borrow from wherever they can get funds most cheaply. When banks borrow from the E.C.B. as lender of last resort, the E.C.B. “prints money” just as it would if it were lending to governments directly.

The burgeoning debts of the Eurozone countries are being blamed on their large welfare states, but these social systems were set up before the 1970s, when European governments had very little national debt.  Their national debts shot up, not because they spent on social services, but because they switched bankers.  Before the 1970s, European governments borrowed from their own central banks.  The money was effectively interest-free, since they owned the banks and got the profits back as dividends.  After the European Monetary Union was established, member countries had to borrow from private banks at interest—often substantial interest.

And the result?  Interest totals for Eurozone countries are not readily accessible; but for France, at least, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8fDLyXXUxM&amp;feature=player_embedded">total sum paid in interest</a> since the 1970s appears to be as great as the French federal debt itself.  <em>That means that if the French government had been borrowing from its central bank all along, it could have been debt-free today</em>.

The figures are <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/1006/1006cdndebt.htm" target="_blank">nearly as bad for Canada</a>, and they may actually be worse for the United States.  The Federal Reserve’s website lists the sums paid in <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm" target="_blank">interest on the U.S. federal debt</a> for the last 24 years.  During that period, taxpayers paid a total of <em>$8.2 trillion</em> in interest.  That’s more than half the total $15 trillion debt, in just 24 years.  The U.S. federal debt has not been paid off since 1835, so taxpayers could well have paid <em>more</em> than $15 trillion by now in interest.  That means our entire federal debt could have been avoided if we had been borrowing from our own government-owned central bank all along, effectively interest-free.  And that is probably true for other countries as well.

To avoid an overwhelming national debt and the forced austerity measures destined to follow, the Eurozone's citizens need to get the fire hose of money creation out of the hands of private banks and back into the hands of the people. But how?

<strong>Governments Cannot Borrow from the E.C.B., but Government-owned Banks Can</strong>

Interestingly, Paragraph 2 of Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty carves out an exception to the rule that governments cannot borrow from the E.C.B. It says that <em>government-owned banks</em> can borrow on the same terms as privately-owned banks. Many Eurozone countries have publicly-owned banks; and as <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.wsj.com%2Fsource%2F2011%2F11%2F14%2Feurope-heading-towards-bank-nationalization%2F&amp;ei=v6bRTrjfG4KXiQL6-eHMCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNFP3ACWLHEbX3SAm6yeHjz1jS3L1g">nationalization of insolvent banks looms</a>, they could soon find themselves with many more.

One solution might be for the publicly-owned banks of Eurozone governments to exercise their right to borrow from the E.C.B. at 1.25%, then use that liquidity to buy up the country's debt, or as much of it as does not sell at auction. (The Federal Reserve does this routinely in open market operations in the U.S.)  The government’s securities would be stabilized, keeping speculators at bay; and the government would get the interest spread, since it would own the banks and would get the profits back as dividends.

<strong>Taking a Stand in the Class War</strong>

In a November 25<sup>th</sup> article titled "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.opednews.com/articles/Goldman-Sachs-Has-Taken-Ov-by-paul-craig-roberts-111125-820.html" target="_blank">Goldman Sachs Has Taken Over</a>," Paul Craig Roberts writes:

"The European Union, just like everything else, is merely another scheme to concentrate wealth in a few hands at the expense of European citizens, who are destined, like Americans, to be the serfs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century."

He observes that Mario Draghi, the new president of the European Central Bank, was Vice Chairman and Managing Director of Goldman Sachs International, a member of Goldman Sachs’ Management Committee, a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, a member of the board of directors of the Bank for International Settlements, and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board<ins>.</ins>  Italy’s new prime minister Mario Monti, who was appointed rather than elected, was a member of Goldman Sachs’ Board of International Advisers, European Chairman of the Trilateral Commission ("a US organization that advances American hegemony over the world"), and a member of the Bilderberg group. And Lucas Papademos, an unelected banker who was installed as prime minister of Greece, was Vice President of the European Central Bank and a member of America’s Trilateral Commission.

Roberts points to the suspicious fact that the German government was unable to sell 35% of its 10-year bonds at its last auction; yet Germany’s economy is in far better shape than that of Italy, which managed to sell all its bonds. Why? Roberts suspects an orchestrated scheme to pressure Germany to back off from its demands to make the banks pay a share of their bailout.

Europe is in the process of being "structurally readjusted" by a private banking cartel. If its people are to resist this silent conquest, they need to rise up and, using the ballot box and public banks, throw out the new banking hegemony before it is too late.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By Jean Ziegler</strong>

The right to food is a Human Right: it might be good to be reminded of that fact as we watch around 6 million children die per year as a result of starvation and nutrition-related diseases. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.righttofood.org/" target="_blank">(1)</a> The right to food sends us back to the very rights to live, and to live in dignity. It is consigned at article 25 §1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/" target="_blank">(2)</a>
<blockquote>1. "Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food (...)"</blockquote>
as well as at article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights of 1966:
<blockquote>Article 11. "The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. "The States Parties will take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of this right, recognizing to this effect the essential importance of international co-operation based on free consent. "The States Parties to the present Covenant, recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger, shall take, individually and through international co-operation, the measures, including specific programmes, which are needed (...)"</blockquote>
It is particularly worth noting that not only does international law recognise the fundamental right to be free from hunger, but it also places the State as the duty bearer of ensuring that this right is implemented and gives it the obligation to take every step possible to realise and implement that right.

As for all Human Rights, the State's obligation are threefold: to respect, to protect and to fulfil. Behind these words lie the following explanations: to respect means that the State shall not take actions or adopt laws that will increase its people's starvation or malnutrition.

To protect means that the State shall prevent powerful institutions and entities from increasing starvation and malnutrition, and to fulfil means that should a situation of starvation or famine arise, the State shall fulfil the right to food directly. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.righttofood.org/new/html/WhatRighttofood.html" target="_blank">(3)</a>

Based on the World Food Programme (WFP) Food Statistics that indicate that 925 million people do not have enough to eat, with 98% of them being in developing countries <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats" target="_blank">(4)</a>, we can deduce that the aforementioned State obligations are not being taken seriously enough.

It is also important to underline the gender component of the global food crisis: also according to the WFP Food Statistics, women make up a little over half of the world's population, but they account for over 60 percent of the world’s hungry. Besides, smallholder farmers <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/y5784e/y5784e02.htm" target="_blank">(5)</a> produce half of the world's food. Among these farmers, 8 out of 10 are women (in Africa, this number reaches 80%) <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.actionaid.org/hungerfree" target="_blank">(6)</a> and they play a key role in counteracting the negative impacts of the global food crisis.

Women's vulnerability has been increased by the HIV/AIDS pandemic when women more often than not become the heads of households, as well as by natural disasters and catastrophes. It is also important to underline that women tend to become more vulnerable to violence when they have no means of sustenance, but also even while working on their lands.

So what are the main causes for malnutrition and starvation? While the impact of climate change has increased food insecurity and is worsening the hunger situation in many countries, the impact of globalisation and neo-liberal policies on price volatility and vulnerability is not to be underestimated.

Indeed, first of all, trade liberalisation and IMF and World Bank policies have had a negative impact on smallholder farmers because on the one hand, the request for and in some cases the imposition of liberalisation of Southern agricultures that came from Northern countries has been coupled with these same governments maintaining subsidies for their own farmers. On the other hand, countries who “benefited” from IMF and World Bank loans are now crippled by the debts they have contracted towards these two institutions.

Trade liberalisation and the complacency of governments who have failed their duty to protect their people's right to food have enabled rich countries and big multinational corporations to buy lands at a very cheap price, making the previous small owners unable to cultivate their own lands, forcing them to become employees of the corporations or to seek elsewhere means of sustenance, increasing their vulnerability.

The high level of productivity of these corporations has impacted on commodity prices and has rendered smallholder farmers who were integrated into regional and national markets unable to compete with cheaper imports, not to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_farming">environmental impact of intensive agriculture</a>.

The costs of neo-liberal policies are economic, environmental and social, and have led to the global food crisis we're currently facing. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.eldis.org/id21ext/s10aml1g1.html" target="_blank">(7)</a> G20 governments are now pouring money and food aid into countries facing food crisis, but these actions, although now much needed, are like putting bandaids over cracks and will not solve the long term issues.

In order to have long term economic growth and significant poverty and hunger reduction, the systemic causes need to be addressed. Cancelling debts, allowing subsidies for Southern agricultural economies, fighting governments' corruption and regulating and monitoring big food industries are just the beginnings of agricultural reforms that should concentrate on supporting farmers' cooperatives and local and national production.

It is high time governments face their responsibility: the right to food is a human right, and appealing for funds to “save people dying from hunger in the South” is just not good enough. It is not charity that is needed, but a real in-depth democratic, social and economic global reforms that puts the state at the core of the development action and involves farmers and citizens. "Nothing about us without us"!]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_17724" align="alignnone" width="414" caption="&quot;Zieg Heil!&quot; - are these Nazis from yesteryear or today?"]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ZIEG-HEIL.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17724" title="ZIEG HEIL" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/ZIEG-HEIL.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="267" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>By Richard Swander</strong>

<em>"In a regular sequence, new 'emergency decrees' appeared every six months, each yet again reducing salaries, pensions, social benefits, and finally even private wages and rates of interest. Each was the logical consequence of the last one, and each time Bruning (German Chancellor 1930-1932), clenching his teeth, imposed the painful logic." From: Defying Hitler: a memoir, by Sebastian Haffner, written in 1939, discovered by his son after his death, published in 2000.</em>

The above haunting words were written by Sebastian Haffner in his 1930s memoirs as a young lawyer in Berlin who experienced first-hand the Nazi takeover.

The economic circumstances that Germans were subjected to seem an eerily relevant description of what we are experiencing today. History seems to be repeating itself as we encounter the current repetitive fiscal emergencies and imposition of 'austerity measures' ad-nauseum. If you listen carefully to the emotional, fatalistic language of 'desperate' politicians, you'll hear a not-so-faint echo of the vitriol of the Third Reich's infamous chancellor.

Through Government media agents, we're told "we need to make sacrifices" or the world and everything in it, will implode and die a painful, agonising death. The new 'emergency decrees' of our times all sound necessary in the 'life-raft' manner they are announced. New legislation or amendments are touted as the saviours of global security, fiscal responsibility or financial stability, but the true, freedom-crushing impact of a few carefully chosen, ambiguous words on a legislative manuscript is only fully understood when it is far too late as Haffner carefully explicates.

The U.S. seems well on its way down the road of no return. Every few months or so, panic-stricken markets have screamed for Economic 'stimulus', quantitative easing or FED intervention to rescue the falling stocks, plunging shares and evaporating confidence. Geithner, Bernanke and Obama can save an America that doesn't need saving by throwing dollars from helicopters. TV anchors at FOX laugh at the brutality of the military-hardware-equipped police, discredit the Occupy movement protesters and anyone questioning the mandated economic prescriptions, while new 'emergency decrees' detain, indefinitely without trial, anyone who protests against the corrupt corporatocracy.

The Eurozone has lead, or replicated, the Wall Street death march; country after country has been picked off by the Goldman Sachs-JP Morgan economic-sniper team. Hyper-inflated debt-rates spew eruptions of panic with their downgrades, and venomous rating agencies collude to kick the fallen while they are down. Meanwhile, neglected technocratic insiders lurk in the shadows, waiting to fill the void left by exiting corporate figure-heads as they run for the hills.

The papers cry 'Eurogeddon' while media pundits envision deserted, litter-strewn streets as they practice for their future positions as sandwich board men declaring the 'end' to be 'nigh'. Sarkozy and Merkel meet behind closed doors and within a few hours draft up new measures to the EU treaty. The speed is a dead giveaway that these measures were drawn up by Wall Street-directed bureaucrats long ago.

They can save a Europe that doesn't need saving by bringing it closer together, centralising the power structure, stripping debt-ridden nations of sovereignty and transferring budgetary control to Brussels. Or so they tell us. But with such financial dictatorship (for that is what they propose), the new United States of Europe will be free to impose the same tyrannical laws upon its member states as those that the United States of America recently legislated in its 'Defence' spending bill.

In the UK, chancellor Osborne and PM David Cameron's Propaganda Media outlets re-frame the new 'emergency' in terms of a new enemy: the public sector workers whose pensions are currently in the cross-hairs. How dare they stand up for their rights?! As if taking his cue from the Lewis Prothero character in the movie V-for-Vendetta, Top-Gear pundit (and contender for public personality idiot of the decade) <strong>Jeremy Clarkson</strong> declared that he would "take them [the protesters] out into the streets and shoot them in front of their families". His fascist outburst on BBC TV provoked 30,000 complaints and serves the purpose of further dividing a browbeaten and confused populace.

Hitler chose Jews, Gypsies and gays to be the common enemy that Germans should rally against. In the Bush era, after the Reichstag fire that was the 9/11 attacks, the 'war on Muslims' became the equivalent of the Nazis' 'war on the Jews'. A decade on from 9/11, Muslims are still being persecuted and demonised by unquestioning, unthinking, obedient readers of Rupert Murdoch's empire of intellectual trash, but increasingly, the focus of this war against the people is turning to a 'war on the so-called 99%'. Protests, riots and popular 'occupations' are occurring throughout the world as the people show their disgust at the egregious corruption in high public and private places, but still, the majority choose to merely watch nonchalantly from the tenuous safety of their living rooms. Can we blame them?

After all that, I do not see that one can blame the majority of Germans who, in 1933, believed that the Reichstag fire was the work of the Communists. What one can blame them for, and what shows their terrible collective weakness of character clearly for the first time during the Nazi period, is that this settled the matter. With sheepish submissiveness the German people accepted that, as a result of the fire, each one of them lost what little personal freedom and dignity was guaranteed by the constitution; as though it followed as a necessary consequence. If the Communists had burned down the Reichstag, it was perfectly in order that the Government took 'decisive measures'!

Haffner's memoirs offer a powerful insight into how normal, every-day folk became rotten to the core, how the decisions individuals make on an everyday basis have ramifications far beyond the initial, seemingly innocuous, mistake of just 'going with the flow'. We are faced with choices everyday: Where we spend our money, where we bank, who we spend our time with and how we invest our precious energy.

Along with reading books on psychopathy and Ponerology, 'Defying Hitler' provides insight as to how we can protect ourselves from being swept up into the, as yet uncharted, territory of a global psychopathic dystopia. As we wake up to the new, dead world around us of collapsed living standards and continuing insane, imperialistic Wars of aggression, there is no reason for anyone to be in the dark about 'how it came to this'. The deceptive justifications that are offered for the slaughter of innocents and the loss of our collective humanity appear to be very effective at keeping most people apathetic. The sad fact of the matter is that the reality that most people are too afraid to confront is just as disturbing as the world-view that the Nazis created for the German people over 70 years ago.

When we look back at what happened in Germany and the conditions that lead to the rise of Hitler and the Nazis, it is with the warm reassurance that those terrifying events of the past will never repeat themselves. I can remember visiting Auschwitz almost twenty years ago: As I looked at the results of the pathology of Nazism with both horror and a distinct feeling of unreality, It seemed unimaginable to me that normal people could allow, let alone take part in such barbaric behaviour.

Today, I often wonder what future generations, assuming there will be any, will say about the current period in our history. I fear it will be viewed with similar horror and a similar forgetfulness that history really does have a strong tendency to repeat itself. I see children in schools, learning about the seemingly bizarre misfortunes of technologically advanced and prospering societies collapsing into their own footprints under the entropic weight of a global fascist regime.

But does it really have to be so bleak and dystopic? A part of me still hopes that the oligarchs and pathocratic ruling elite will be overcome, somehow, by the world-wide popular revolt that appears to be gaining momentum. But time is running out for many members of 'the 99%' to awaken and change the history of our future.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17730" title="referendum30" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/referendum30.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" />
<em>YES and NO were one of the first words we said when we were babies, but now we have grown...</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/green-charter-south-europa/" target="_blank">Green Charter South Europa</a></strong>

When we were children, our parents often repeated: "Do not accept candy from strangers, it may be drugs!" Parents want the best for their children, we must listen to their teachings, but as time passes and we grow up, we often forget their helpful advice.

Today, unfortunately, we accept candies from strangers and, just like our parents told us, they are drugs, they are hallucinogenic substances that make us see what there is not, show us democracy where, in reality, there is no democracy at all.

Imagine in your everyday life, at work, with your friends or with your family, imagine you can only say YES or NO and can not express your real thoughts (as there are many shades between YES and NO), what kind of life would that be; how would you be able to express your ideas? If the only accepted answers are YES or NO, then the one who asks the question is able to manipulate the result of the responses. Those who work in sales are well aware of the fact that this is a sales technique, it is the questions that direct the answers!

Democracy however is something different from a simple choice between YES or NO; democracy is the direct participation of the masses in the government of the nations.

The question is very simple, just listen to our parents, just listen to the teachings of our Great Brother Leader Muammar Qadhafi who wrote in the Great <a title="GREEN BOOK" href="http://www.greencharter.com/files/gb.htm">Green Book</a>:
<blockquote>"Plebiscites are a fraud against democracy. Those who vote "yes" or "no" do not, in fact, express their free will but, rather, are silenced by the modern conception of democracy as they are not allowed to say more than "yes" or "no". Such a system is oppressive and tyrannical. Those who vote "no" should express their reasons and why they did not say "yes", and those who say "yes" should verify such agreement and why they did not vote "no". Both should state their wishes and be able to justify their "yes" or "no" vote. "</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">and:</p>

<blockquote> "The intricate problem in the case of democracy is reflected in the nature of the instrument of government, which is demonstrated by conflicts of classes, parties and individuals. The elections and plebiscites were invented to cover the failure of these unsuccessful experiments to solve this problem. The solution lies in finding an instrument of government other than those which are subject to conflict and which represent only one faction of society; that is to say, an instrument of government which is not a party class, sect or a tribe, but an instrument of government which is the people as a whole. In other words, we seek an instrument of government which neither represents the people nor speaks in their name.</blockquote>
Furthermore, in his speech of Februay 22, Qadhafi like a good parent warned the Libyan people about the drugs the rebels were on... not on real pills like the blinded mainstream media ridiculously reported, but on the drug of so-called Western 'democracy', provided and imposed by the NATO countries!

Plebiscites and referendums are functioning as drugs that attack the bodies and the minds of the masses and are also very expensive for a nation (and costs of a plebiscite are paid by the masses too!). For example, in Italy, the average cost of the last referendum was 365 million Euro; this money was a total waste because a quorum to make the referendum valid is 50% of voters, which rarely has been achieved in recent years.

Maybe that amount of money would better be spent to secure the territory (see floods and landslides which are increasingly affecting us in Europe), to build new hospitals and schools, or simply to lower taxes (in Italy we are still watching the level of fees, with the new economic measures of the new prime minister Monti it reached 45% of people's income, thus about half of what  Italian workers earns they spend on taxes!!! It's a shame!).

It's time to evolve a political system of the nations towards a form of <a href="http://peoplesconference.org/pc/" target="_blank">direct democracy</a>, it's time to stop the mistakes of the ruling caste.

It's time to grow, it's time to speak to the masses and to awaken from the slumber of false democracy's drugs!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is truly amazing and one of the best I've read from you so far, it's great and a wonderful comparison. The very first thing that crossed my mind when I read about the hallucinogens substances was Qaddafi's speech on February 22 in which he said the rebels were on 'halwasa' (drugs), and I always of course understood he meant that figuratively, but now I realize he might have meant it the exact same way as you described it so beautifully. So, my question is: can I add one or two sentences with a reference to Qaddafi's speech about the drugs?

I also hope Auntie Adjeley can do a final English check again.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Gaddafi and Libya: a young American&#039;s rant</title>

<em>A young American speaks out against the Western war on Libya and the mainstream media which portrayed Gaddafi as a cruel dictator who was "killing his own people".</em>

After having read the <a href="http://www.greencharter.com/files/gb.htm" target="_blank">Green Book</a>, he wonders why people are even calling Gaddafi a dictator as Gaddafi didn't have any real power because he gave all <a href="http://peoplesconference.org/pc/" target="_blank">power to the people</a> and also made Libya the most prosperous African Nation.

He notices that the NATO-rebels are "nothing but animals" and that they are still killing Libyan people every day, especially black Libyans, and concludes that "Gaddafi made the 'democracy' of the United States look like a big fat joke."

About the videos below he said: "I just want people to understand that not everyone outside of North Africa or the Middle East is ignorant to what's going on right now. As an American, not at all do I approve of the horrible, inhumane activities that NATO has sponsored to these rebels."

I found this at the forum btw: https://mathaba.org/topic_show.pl?tid=393 as he says he's new at mathaba I don't think he's to blame for considering Qaddafi being killed (like he says in the videos).]]></wp:comment_content>

Gheddafi e la Libia: dichiarazione di un giovane americano.

Un giovane americano ha rilasciato alcune dichiarazioni contro la guerra dell'Occidente alla Libia e contro i media accreditati, i quali hanno ritratto Gheddafi come un dittatore crudele che stava "uccidendo il suo stesso popolo".
Dopo aver letto il Libro Verde, egli si chiede perché la gente abbia definito Gheddafi come un dittatore, mentre Gheddafi invece non aveva alcun potere reale, perché ha dato tutto il potere al popolo, facendo della Libia la più prospera nazione africana.
Egli evidenzia come i NATO-ribelli  non siano in realtà "altro che degli animali", i quali stanno tutt'ora uccidendo la popolazione libica, ogni giorno, soprattutto i libici neri, concludendo che "Gheddafi ha fatto sì che la 'democrazia' degli Stati Uniti sembri al confronto solo un grande e grosso scherzo".
Circa i video, qui sotto riportati, ha detto: "Voglio solo che la gente capisca che non tutti, al di fuori del Nord Africa o del Medio Oriente, sono ignoranti riguardo a quello che, proprio ora, sta accadendo. Come americano, non posso assolutamente approvare le orribili, disumane attività, che la NATO ha sponsorizzato attraverso questi 'ribelli' ".

<em>Only two persons have ever represented labor on Penn State's Board of Trustees.</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/brasch/" target="_blank">Walter Brasch</a></strong>

<strong></strong>Although more than one million Pennsylvanians are members of labor unions, and the state has a long history of worker exploitation and union activism, neither of the two largest university systems has a labor representative on its governing board.

The only labor representative on the Board of Governors of the State System of Higher Education (SSHE) in its 28 year history was Julius Uehlein, who served 1988–1995 while Pennsylvania AFL–CIO president. The appointment was made by Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat.

Only two persons have ever represented labor on Penn State’s Board of Trustees. Gov. Milton Shapp, a Democrat, appointed Harry Boyer, the state AFL–CIO president, in 1973. Shortly after Boyer retired in 1988, he resigned as a trustee. Richard Trumka, a Penn State alumnus and Villanova law school graduate, now the national AFL–CIO president, served as a trustee, 1983–1995, while president of the United Mine Workers. He was first appointed by Gov. Dick Thornburgh, a Republican, reappointed by Gov. Casey, and not reappointed when Tom Ridge, a Republican, became governor.

The 32-member Penn State Board of Trustees is divided into five groups: <em>ex-officio</em> members (6), Governor appointments (6), members elected by the Alumni Association (8), Business and Industry members (6), and elected members from Agriculture (6). The Agriculture representation dates to 1862 when Penn State (at that time known as Farmer’s High School) was one of the first two land grant institutions; the land grant institutions were created to provide advanced education in agriculture and the sciences. Currently, 15 members either are or were CEOs. Among them are the CEOs of U.S. Steel and Merck. One of the <em>ex-officio </em>members is the Penn State president, which creates an interesting potential for a conflict-of-interest. Except for one student representative, most of the rest are lawyers or senior corporate or public agency executives. Only six members are women, only three are members of minority classes.

The lack of diversity became an issue this week when the Faculty Senate called for a more diverse board. The challenge to the Trustees was unusual because the Senate “has always been a relatively non-confrontational group,” according to Dr. Paul Clark, head of the university’s prestigious Department of Labor Studies and Employment Relations, who had served as a senator for 15 years. However, child molestation charges against former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, combined with how poorly the university administration and the secrecy-clad Trustees handled the problem, exposed the university and trustees to additional scrutiny.

“Because of the number of union members in Pennsylvania, and the need to have working people’s issues and perspectives represented on the board, we always thought it made a lot of sense for that constituency [working class] to be represented on the trustees,” says Dr. Clark.

At one time, Penn State had an active labor studies advisory committee, dating back to the early 1950s when Milton Eisenhower was the university president. That committee met at least four times a year and “was well respected,” says Irwin Aronson, general counsel for the Pennsylvania AFL–CIO, and a Penn State labor studies graduate. After Dr. Graham Spanier became president in 1995, the committee quickly dissolved because “he didn’t seem to have much interest in it,” says Richard Bloomingdale, Pennsylvania AFL–CIO president. There is no doubt, says Aronson, that “the previously warm relationship between labor and Penn State’s administration collapsed under Dr. Spanier’s administration.” Bloomingdale says he hopes Rodney Erickson, Penn State’s newly-appointed president, will see the necessity to reinstate the committee.

Penn State also has what may be the state’s premiere collection of labor history primary source documents, especially from the coal region. The letters, notes, diaries and other materials are archived in the Paterno Library.

Penn State is a state-related private university which received $279 million in state funding for the current fiscal year; it has 94,000 students on its 24 campuses, with 44,000 of the students enrolled on its main campus. About 3,000 Penn State staff (mostly those working in maintenance, physical plant, dormitories, and the cafeteria) are members of the Teamsters. About 1,300 registered nurses, including those of the Hershey Medical Center, are members of the Service Employees International Union. However, there is no faculty union at Penn State. Part of the problem, says Dr. Clark, is that faculty in the large business and agriculture colleges, plus those in engineering and science, tend not to have strong union loyalties; those in the liberal arts tend to have more acceptance of the value of unions.

SSHE, the larger of the two systems, has 120,000 students enrolled in 14 universities. Its 20-member Board of Governors isn’t much more diverse than Penn State’s. The Board has three student representatives who are appointed by the Board after being nominated by the presidents of the 14 universities. However, because of the way the students are nominated by presidents of the individual campuses and then selected by the Board of Governors, most usually have views similar to what the administration sees as mainstream and acceptable. Membership also includes four legislators, selected from each political caucus (Democrat and Republican caucuses in the House and Senate) and the secretary of the Department of Education; the rest are appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the state senate. Gov. Tom Corbett and his designated representative, Jennifer Branstetter, a public relations executive, serve on both Penn State and SSHE boards. Most of the other members are lawyers or senior business executives. One of them, Kenneth M. Jarin, who served as chair for six years and is currently a member, is a lawyer who represents management in labor issues.

The lack of at least one representative of labor on the SSHE Board of Governors is because of “a lack of sensitivity to the labor point of view,” says Dr. Stephen Hicks, president of the Association of Pennsylvania State College &amp; University Faculties (APSCUF), which represents 6,400 faculty. Dr. Hicks, who has tried to get the Board to include a faculty member, says that when a Board has most of its members “who have run a business and made money, you get a certain viewpoint.”

Richard Bloomingdale says he’s proposed to the boards and governor persons who could effectively represent the working class, “but they were always turned down.”

Even one representative, says Bloomingdale, “would still leave the Boards with heavy pro-business orientations.”

There is no question that politics and a pro-business or anti-labor philosophy has left working class Pennsylvanians with no representation on the boards of universities that are designated as “the people’s universities.”

Unfortunately, the lack of labor representation is the case at almost every public university in America.

<em>Does your government have an Internet kill-switch? Read our guide to Guerrilla Networking and be prepared for when the lines get cut.</em>

<strong>By Patrick Miller and David Daw</strong>

These days, no popular movement goes without an Internet presence of some kind, whether it's organizing on Facebook or spreading the word through Twitter. And as we've seen in <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.pcworld.com/article/218052/egypt_expands_communications_blackout.html" target="_blank">Egypt</a>, that means that your Internet connection can be the first to go. Whether you're trying to check in with your family, contact your friends, or simply spread the word, here are a few ways to build some basic network connectivity when you can't rely on your cellular or landline Internet connections.
<div id="mac_tags">

<strong>Do-It-Yourself Internet With Ad-Hoc Wi-Fi</strong>

Even if you've managed to find an Internet connection for yourself, it won't be that helpful in reaching out to your fellow locals if they can't get online to find you. If you're trying to coordinate a group of people in your area and can't rely on an Internet connection, cell phones, or SMS, your best bet could be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_mesh_network" target="_blank">wireless mesh network</a> of sorts--essentially, a distributed network of wireless networking devices that can all find each other and communicate with each other. Even if none of those devices have a working Internet connection, they can still find each other, which, if your network covers the city you're in, might be all you need. At the moment, wireless mesh networking isn't really anywhere close to market-ready, though we have seen an implementation of the 802.11s draft standard, which extends the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard to include wireless mesh networking, in the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.pcworld.com/article/140931/first_look_olpcs_xo_laptop.html" target="_blank">One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) XO laptop</a>.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17767" title="daihinia" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/daihinia.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="219" />However, a prepared guerrilla networker with a handful of PCs could make good use of <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://daihinia.com/" target="_blank">Daihinia</a> ($25, 30-day free trial), an app that piggybacks on your Wi-Fi adapter driver to turn your normal ad-hoc Wi-Fi network into a multihop ad-hoc network (disclaimer: we haven't tried this ourselves yet), meaning that instead of requiring each device on the network to be within range of the original access point, you simply need to be within range of a device on the network that has Daihinia installed, effectively allowing you to add a wireless mesh layer to your ad-hoc network.

Advanced freedom fighters can set up a portal Web page on their network that explains the way the setup works, with Daihinia instructions and a local download link so they can spread the network even further. Lastly, just add a Bonjour-compatible chat client like <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://pidgin.im/" target="_blank">Pidgin</a> or iChat, and you'll be able to talk to your neighbors across the city without needing an Internet connection.

<em><strong>Revolutionary How-Tos</strong></em>
<em>What to do when your government shuts down your Internet access and other useful tools:</em>
<ol>
	<li><em><a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/220152/take_your_tech_off_the_grid.html" target="_blank">Take Your Tech Off the Grid</a></em></li>
	<li><em><a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.pcworld.com/article/222707/start_a_revolution_with_your_personal_tech.html" target="_blank">Start A Revolution With Your Personal Tech</a></em></li>
</ol>
<strong>Back to Basics</strong>

Remember when you stashed your old modems in the closet because you thought you might need them some day? In the event of a total communications blackout--as we're seeing in Egypt, for example--you'll be glad you did. Older and simpler tools, like dial-up Internet or even ham radio, could still work, since these "abandoned" tech avenues aren't being policed nearly as hard.

In order to get around the total shutdown of all of the ISPs within Egypt, several international ISPs are offering dial-up access to the Internet to get protesters online, since phone service is still operational. It's slow, but it still works--the hard part is getting the access numbers without an Internet connection to find them.

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-17768" title="fidonet" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fidonet.png" alt="" width="162" height="212" />Unfortunately, such dial-up numbers can also be fairly easily shut down by the Egyptian government, so you could also try returning to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet" target="_blank">FidoNet</a>--a distributed networking system for BBSes that was popular in the 1980s. FidoNet is limited to sending only simple text messages, and it's slow, but it has two virtues: Users connect asynchronously, so the network traffic is harder to track, and any user can act as the server, which means that even if the government shuts down one number in the network, another one can quickly pop up to take its place.

You could also take inspiration from groups that are working to create an ad-hoc communications network into and out of Egypt using <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://werebuild.eu/wiki/Egypt/Main_Page#Hamradio" target="_blank">Ham Radio</a>, since the signals are rarely tracked and extremely hard to shut down or block. Most of these efforts are still getting off the ground, but hackers are already cobbling together ways to make it a viable form of communication into and out of the country.

<strong>Always Be Prepared</strong>

In the land of no Internet connection, the man with dial-up is king. Here are a few gadgets that you could use to prepare for the day they cut the lines.

Given enough time and preparation, your ham radio networks could even be adapted into your own ad-hoc network using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_radio" target="_blank">Packet Radio</a>, a radio communications protocol that you can use to create simple long-distance wireless networks to transfer text and other messages between computers. Packet Radio is rather slow and not particularly popular (don't try to stream any videos with this, now), but it's exactly the kind of networking device that would fly under the radar.

<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-17769" title="terminal-node-controller" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/terminal-node-controller.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" />In response to the crisis in Egypt, nerds everywhere have risen to call for new and exciting tools for use in the next government-mandated shutdown. Bre Pettis, founder of the hackerspace <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.nycresistor.com/" target="_blank">NYC Resistor</a> and creator of the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.makerbot.com/" target="_blank">Makerbot</a> 3D printer, has called for "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.brepettis.com/blog/2011/1/28/apps-for-the-appocolypse.html" target="_blank">Apps for the Appocalypse</a>," including a quick and easy way to set up chats on a local network so you can talk with your friends and neighbors in an emergency even without access to the Internet. If his comments are any indication, Appocalypse apps may be headed your way soon.

Tons of cool tech are also just waiting to be retrofitted for these purposes. David Dart's <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox" target="_blank">Pirate Box</a> is a one-step local network in a box originally conceived for file sharing and local P2P purposes, but it wouldn't take much work to adapt the Pirate Box as a local networking tool able to communicate with other pirate boxes to form a compact, mobile set of local networks in the event of an Internet shutdown.

Whether you're in Egypt or Eagle Rock, you rely on your Internet access to stay in touch with friends and family, get your news, and find information you need (and read <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.pcworld.com/" target="_blank">PCWorld</a>, of course). Hopefully with these apps, tools, and techniques, you won't have to worry about anyone--even your government--keeping you from doing just that.

<strong>Lisa Karpova</strong>
<strong>Pravda.ru</strong>

Tomorrow the heroes will stay home.

The west, and particularly the United States, are not in a position to criticise the Russian election process, nor are they in a position to criticise the ever popular leader, Vladimir Putin. It is well known that what makes Vladimir Putin so supremely electable are all of his great deeds in restoring Russia to a decent place in the world, with much worldwide respect, fiscally sound and responsible, strong and stable.

Who can compete with that in the bankrupt, hypocritical, international law breaking, war mongering west where you will find no stronger, more determined supporters of terrorism? Can even one leader be found among the lot of them that actually did something for the people in their own country?

Absolutely not.

Russia is a country with its own time honored traditions, a source of much pride for every Russian citizen. The history, the culture and beauty have no rivals anywhere.

The west is the one who lost everything with the pseudo-conclusion of the Cold War. They can no longer be looked upon in the same manner as before. The curtain fell, the wall is down....the empire is naked, the emperor is naked.

Their Wall Street public relations (PR) firms were selling a highly DEFECTIVE product, the concept of "freedom and democracy" in the west.

Casting a vote is no guarantee that any citizen in the west has anything to say about what their country does, be it in matters of social services to society or foreign issues. All you have to do is look at Yugoslavia, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Pakistan, Syria...is there any end to the list?

Every time the subject of debt, inflation, unemployment or homelessness comes up...there is money for war and foreign adventures, there is money for subversion in other countries, but none for the people! The people are expected to make up the difference, endure pay cuts, more taxes, greatly diminished social services and loss of personal security, totally. There are no guarantees of anything in the west, besides the right to DIE.

And then, if you're a soldier committing war crimes, you might end up in the city dump in a mass grave, as was recently reported about some US casualties. This is your disposable society, everything and everyone is disposable.

Are you sick and have no insurance? Die! You have no money for the electric bill? Freeze! You cannot pay your mortgage because you lost a job that was shipped overseas? Sleep under a bridge! Or better yet, die!

Meanwhile, your western government is paying agitators and terrorists to bring down the legitimate governments in other countries. Paying the slime of the earth to destroy what was built with great sacrifice.

Besides the big mouths of freaks like <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629562" target="_blank">Hillary "War Zone" Clinton</a> and John old timers' disease war monger Mc Cain, many fraudulent videos were made prior to the elections where they tried to pass them off as filmed on election day - utter complete fakes! In one video in the western media, they forgot to change the date on a wall calendar from November 25 to December 4. One prominent media source showed scenes from Greece and told the viewers they were seeing scenes from Moscow while observant viewers noted the difference between the Greek and Russian alphabets as unmistakable.

Such obvious interference in Russia's internal affairs, according to international law, is an act of war.

There is no more despicable creature on this planet than those who destroy the heritage and sacrifices of their land for the filthy promise of payment, 30 pieces of silver. As people could tell such rot-brained money grubbing traitors, from the countries listed as the victims in this space, you don't know what you've got until you lose it.

Attaching oneself to a collapsing empire is totally unhealthy for freedom, security, peace and well being. So is making a monkey of oneself by chanting dictated, rehearsed, canned phrases for pay.

Just examine the situation of countries that used to be part of the Warsaw Pact who now find themselves destitute, disadvantaged, poor, powerless, and especially...disillusioned...there is no shortage of such people, just do a little research and don't believe the western corporate media.

Speaking of the media, it has been soundly shown that "freedom of the press" shouted, proclaimed and put forth as the ultimate freedom, DOES NOT EXIST IN THE WEST.

On the other hand, not once has anyone ever interfered with what we say here in this space. The western corporate media is in complete and total lockstep in promoting the western war machine's disinformation.

Russians have always been able to survive and make unprecedented progress within the framework of patriotism, loyalty and determination.

Is there one single US or western politician that has been elected from among the ranks of the people or are they all carefully selected, screened and of course rich and dishonest in order to get elected? Do they act for the people or do they act for the rich, the privileged, the corporations, the lobbyists, the elite...those that find it necessary to wage war in order to collect spoils?? Clearly they are chosen by MONEY, and nothing else.

Ask people like Cynthia Mc Kinney, Dennis Kucinich, Ron Paul and generally the Green Party and other third parties how fair the US elections system is and how the ordinary citizen has nothing to say about who gets to be put on the ballot or be elected there. Can we discuss hanging chads and the Diebold frauds in Florida and Ohio?

The grass is definitely not greener, in fact there's no grass at all over there, only WEEDS.

Today was marked as Heroes' Day in Russia. Never forget the heroes and the sacrifices they have made. It is much better to try and be worthy of that heritage than to aspire to something intrinsically EVIL, a shiny white tomb with nothing but dead men's bones inside.

Perdition is the only thing obtained from making deals with the devil. Ask any number of players, Sadaam Hussein comes to mind as one obvious example. Judas is another example, things really went well for him.

Actually it is the epitome of stupidity to make deals with a bankrupt hand, is it not? Those accepting the filthy lucre should put down that drink, that drug and realise the responsibility for the country is in the hands of each citizen.

Russians not only defended and liberated themselves, but liberated other countries, too. In the early 19th century, the Russian army defeated Napoleon. Fighting a war against the Turks fifty years later, the Russian army liberated the Balkans. During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Red army defeated Nazi Germany and Hitler and thus saved the world from the fascist plague and Nazism.

Now the spectre of Nazism and fascism are back, embodied in the west. Something as demonic as the pits of hell, making human sacrifice in exchange for resources...who needs to buy into the utter filth and deception they are selling? It is dirty, unholy...

And a word to the eurotrash eurocrats, nobody but nobody elected you, so best keep quiet. You already have enough innocent blood on your hands for which you will pay dearly, one way or the other.

The west has utterly miscalculated Russia, neither do they understand her. Neither do they show her the proper respect as is due for countless, infinite reasons. That will change with Vladimir Putin and United Russia. What began as utter success will continue as a bright future for all Russians.

The agitators, the tweeters, the Twitter and Facebook monkeys can all go to hell...trying to stir up color revolution. Let them cram it where the sun don't shine. You too, HELLary Loud Mouth, frustrated man wannabe, incompetent know-nothing.]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_17806" align="alignnone" width="500" caption="Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani (1st, L) chairs an emergency meeting of the Defence Committee of the Cabinet (DCC) in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan, on November 26, 2011."]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/GOODBYE-UNCLE-SAM.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-17806" title="GOODBYE UNCLE SAM" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/GOODBYE-UNCLE-SAM-500x300.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" /></a>[/caption]

<strong>By Jalees Hazir</strong>

Last Friday, Prime Minister Gilani warned the US and its NATO allies that any future attack on Pakistan will be met with a 'detrimental response'. Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Committee on National Security has been entrusted with the task of reviewing the Pak-US relations and its recommendations are to be presented to the upcoming joint session of Parliament.

A conference of Pakistan's Ambassadors and High Commissioners is expected to start tomorrow in Islamabad to review the situation following the Mohmand attack last month that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. The NATO supplies passing through Pakistan were blocked after the attack and the Shamsi Airbase that was being used by the alliance has been vacated.

Finally, the government seems to have woken up to the urgent need of a new perspective on the US war in Afghanistan and our role in it. Distancing ourselves from the global badmash will create the space necessary to cooperate more closely with the other neighbours of Afghanistan to bring an end to the US occupation there and work together for peace in the region.

Amidst these momentous developments, one still hears the bay-ghairat brigade squealing about the consequences of disobeying the badmash superpower. They harp on the same old tunes that they repeat ever time an effort is made to work towards an independent foreign policy. Essentially, they frighten us with three doomsday fallouts that they insist we can ill-afford.

To begin with, they warn us that we cannot go to war with the superpower, suggesting that any effort to break free from the stranglehold of US policy would result in an all-out war. Then they tell us that our economy will collapse without the funds we receive in aid and loans from the US and the international financial institutions under its wings.

Finally, they tell us that Pakistan will be over-run by militants and extremism if we walk away from the US, and the only way we could save ourselves from that fate is to blindly follow the US diktat. They would like to convince us of the helplessness of our situation. Their arguments betray their slavish mentality more than anything else.

Let's take the last argument first. The decade-long US occupation of Afghanistan has actually fuelled militancy and extremism not only in the ravaged country, but also in Pakistan. Armed resistance has emerged, as the only way to fight occupation by a ruthless and unscrupulous foreign army in Afghanistan. And in our tribal areas, death of innocent civilians by drone strikes has pushed more and more young people into the ranks of militant outfits.

There are also reasons to believe that the US has a direct role in funding and arming militant groups and manipulating them to its ends. Millions of dollars were, reportedly, doled out to warlords in Afghanistan by the US to ensure safe passage of its supplies through the areas controlled by them. Similarly, the Raymond Davis episode exposed the shady liaison that CIA maintained with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. It is unfortunate that the civil and military leadership helped him escape the country, rather than getting to the bottom of the matter.

In any case, religious extremism and militancy are not problems that we can solve by hiding behind the dirty shoulders of a meddlesome and widely-hated superpower. It is actually the job of Pakistani leaders to tackle the twin menace of religious extremism and militancy and, as it is becoming clearer by the day, it can't be done through US-directed military operations. In fact, the problem must be approached in a holistic way, reforming various aspects of religious institutions and education that feed these trends, and taking stock of the social and economic context within which they grow. Military power might be required in certain cases, but surely the entire strategy cannot be based on shooting them down.

The argument about the economic collapse is also myopic. It has been reported that Pakistan did not receive a single dollar from the US this year, nothing under the Kerry-Lugar eyewash and nothing under the head of the Coalition Support Fund. As far as the IMF is concerned, its poisonous loan injections are known around the world for their crippling effects on the poorest sections of the population. We have seen it in full action in recent years, complete with its prescriptions of indirect taxation and increases in the cost of utilities.

IMF loans and dole-outs from the US and its rich NATO allies are actually instruments of colonial control that only serve to create a false notion of dependency. Other than feeding corruption among the bureaucratic and political elite, with some crumbs thrown to consultants and employers of various useless and fruitless projects, they serve little purpose. We would be actually better off without these dole- outs and crippling loans, and could finally sit down to fashion our economic policies based on our own needs and resources.

The most absurd argument is about a war with the US. Basically, it asks us to behave like a pigeon, who closes its eyes on seeing an approaching cat. Whether we like it or not, the US is engaged in an undeclared war against Pakistan that it sees as a hurdle in its plans for the region. Obviously, eliminating safe havens of terrorism is just an excuse.

Whether it is the posturing of its puppet government in Afghanistan and its strategic partner India, or its aggressive meddling in which gas pipeline should be built between which countries, the signs are too many to ignore. In fact, it would be difficult to come to any other conclusion if one were to connect the many damning dots from the previous years. If the bay-ghairat brigade didn't see it before, the Mohmand attack should have made it clear as daylight. So what are they saying basically? That we should let ourselves be bled by an enemy just because it comes disguised as a friend?

A war is not such a good thing and no sensible person would advocate starting one, with a weak country or the mightiest military alliance. At the same time, the bay-ghairat brigade should understand that taking cognisance of a war brought to our border and defending ourselves from the deceptive attacks by a so-called ally does not amount to starting a war. In fact, this is the only way to end the unjust war across the border that has gone on for too long!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

Not long ago, I thought that calling the United States of America “Public Enemy Number One” would be an unacceptable way to being an opinion article. Today, that is a fact after it becomes apparent that the USA has been directly involved in the opposition protests inside Russia after United Russia won a free and fair democratic process. Let us see.

Here are some soundbites spread across western media outlets: “It is scandalous and vulgar”. “We have done our own calculations, and….I won”. “We are really disappointed, we voted for the other candidate but this one won”. Interesting. In fact these comments do not come from Russia, but from Africa, more precisely from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where Etienne Tshisekedi disputed the election victory of Joseph Kabila, a continent where increasingly, election results are disputed and manipulated by outside powers, as we saw recently in the case of Laurent Gbagbo and the Ivory Coast.

However nebulous the election results from these two countries may have been (or not), Russia’s are crystal clear, in an election process whose administration was, according to observers, efficient:

United Russia won 238 of the 450 seats in the DUMA (Parliament), giving it a majority over the opposition parties (Communists, 92; Just Russia, 64 and Liberal Democratic Party, 56. Yabloko, Patriots of Russia and Right Cause did not elect any members). United Russia got 52.88% of the seat composition in the Duma, against 20.46% for the Communists, 14.21% for Just Russia, 12.45% for the Liberal Democratic Party and zero per cent for the other contenders. United Russia received 32,331,244 votes, against 12,594,232 for the Communists, 8,689,147 for Just Russia, 7,659,657 for the Liberal Democrats, 2,249,990 for Yabloko, 638,735 for the Patriots of Russia and 392,507 for the Right Cause. United Russia garnered just under 50% of the vote, the second most voted party, the Communists, less than 20%.

So where exactly is the problem? Do the USA and its poodles in Europe want the Communist Party to win? I thought they spent half a century deriding Communism as evil, and now they take the side of the opposition, whose main party is the CPRF? How interesting.

However easy it is to make a quick video, claiming “FRAUD!” and downloading it onto youtube, backed up by belligerent and intrusive arrogant remarks from the likes of Hillary “War Zone” Clinton who classifies a welcome with a band and a red carpet as stepping off an aircraft into the middle of a war zone, one thing is the accusation, another is an investigation into irregularities.

In a country as vast as the Russian Federation, however well organised the process is, it is perfectly natural that there will be issues, isolated incidents which may or may not alter a few details but certainly not a result in which the winner garners 50% and the second-placed party, 20%.

Regarding the protests, the Russian police have been congratulated this weekend on their management of the demonstrations fuelled mainly by the Communist Party and also the representatives of those who lost, three of these parties not managing to elect one single member of parliament. What does the USA then think, that these parties won?

If United Russia elects 238 members of the Duma and Yabloko none, then does Hillary Clinton claim that Yabloko won the election? If United Russia garners 32 million votes and the Communist Party 8 million, does Hillary Clinton think that the Communist Party should win? If United Russia got nearly 53% of the seats in the DUMA, then does Hillary Clinton think that Zhirinovsky’s Liberal Democrats should have won when they got less than 13%?

Obviously, as in any country, protests and demonstrations have to be properly registered and policed and this was the case in Russia this weekend. Compared to the mass rallies in the 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of people turned out, this Saturday the largest peaceful and legalised demonstration had around 30,000 people, at most. In a population of 140,000,000…

Let us remember in July one million people (one fifth of the population of the country) turned out in the streets of Tripoli to march against NATO and its criminal murderous attack against Libya, and NATO then refused to allow the Libyan Government to hold a free and fair democratic election. So much for democracy, eh what?

Now for intrusion and I reiterate my claim that the USA is public enemy number one. There are claims in Moscow that the USA has been financing groups of people inside Russia to stir up problems. The figure of 500 Roubles per person has been quoted. Should this be the case, then how does the US taxpayer feel, how does the US citizen feel, (s)he who worked hard all his/her life to buy a house and has lost it in foreclosure, to know that thousands upon thousands of dollars are being wasted funding unrest on the streets of Russia?

Is the USA public enemy number one, or what?

And for those media outlets and hysterical politicians deriding the elections, has anyone bothered to check out the role of the USA’s National Endowment for Democracy organization? It is funded by the US Government and among those involved in claiming that there was electoral fraud in Russia are those belonging to the NED’s World Democracy Movement. One of these is Vladimir Ryzhkov, who appears on the Internet with a Washington DC address. Others were, according to reports, polling station monitors, paid to stir up problems.

In fact, many of these weird and wonderful creatures springing up inside or outside Russia’s borders claiming how unfair the election process was, have direct links to the NED or other US-based or US-financed organisms, such as Neo-Con, Fortune 500, Henry Jackson Foundation, Moscow Helsinki Group, Strategy 31 and so on.

Let us take a look at GOLOS, a Russian election monitoring organization. Interesting, because on the US National Endowment for Democracy website, we read:

<strong>“Regional Civic Organization in Defense of Democratic Rights and Liberties “GOLOS”</strong>
$65,000
To carry out a detailed analysis of the autumn 2010 and spring 2011 election cycles in Russia, which will include press monitoring, monitoring of political agitation, activity of electoral commissions, and other aspects of the application of electoral legislation in the long-term run-up to the elections. GOLOS will hold local and national press conferences and publish reports on its findings, as well as provide detailed methodological advice to its monitors and other monitoring agencies.”

65,000 USD (sixty-five thousand USD). Ah yeah and here’s <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.ned.org/where-we-work/eurasia/russia" target="_blank">the website</a>.

So, it seems that the allegations that the USA is intrinsically involved in the Russian Opposition’s claims are true, to the tune of countless thousands of dollars. Oh well, as the US taxpayer struggles to meet the bills this Christmas, it’s nice to know where your government spends your hard-earned tax dollars.

So yes, the United States of America is Public Enemy Number One. This is a country controlled by a clique of lobbies fuelled by the corporate greed of the arms, drugs and banking sectors, it is a country whose Vice-President and AIPAC wield more power than the President, neutered before he took office and a country which simply cannot mind its own business and sort out its own problems. Obama is a fraud, Hillary is the snake in the woodpile.

Fitting it is that the colour these Satanic disciples chose for the colour revolution in Russia was white, the colour of cowardice, the colour of those who surrender. Maybe it is time for a colour revolution to begin inside the USA. From five minutes’ research on the Net, there is a Pandora’s box of movements ready and waiting.

See Hillary, spit in the wind and…and Obama, you should be ashamed of yourself.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Wall Street versus Russia, who is behind it?</em>

<strong>By Tony Cartalucci</strong>

<strong>1. Wall Street-London's Defense Team for Jailed Russian Oligarch Khodorkovsky</strong>

The background of jailed Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his "Open Russian Foundation" fashioned after George Soros' Open Society Institute and chaired by both Jacob Rothschild and Henry Kissinger, can be found in William Engdahl's, "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.voltairenet.org/The-Real-Crime-of-M-Khodorkovsky" target="_blank">The Real Crime of M. Khodorkovsky</a>," as well as in the London Telegraph's humorously titled, "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3607189/This-man-is-now-the-peoples-billionaire.html" target="_blank">This man is now the people's billionaire</a>," reflecting the paid-for rhetoric of Khodorkovsky's Wall Street-London-appointed lawyer <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/02/globalist-page-robert-amsterdam.html">Robert Amsterdam</a>.

In the latest round <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/12/us-atempts-to-overthrow-russian.html">of attempted destabilization in Russia</a>, it may be instructive to look at the "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/" target="_blank">Khodorkovsky &amp; Lebedev Communications Center</a>," a website developed in part by Robert Amsterdam and what is called an "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/about" target="_blank">international legal team</a>." Coincidentally, it fully embraces the narrative peddled by the West and its corporate media that the Russian elections were "rigged." However, this accusation tenuously hinges on the work of US-funded NGOs including Golos - <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.ned.org/where-we-work/eurasia/russia" target="_blank">fully funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED)</a>.

Just as Robert Amsterdam is doing in Thailand, where he is using his "defense" of ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra as a point of leverage to in fact <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/08/confirmed-thailands-pro-democracy.html">induce regime change in the Southeast Asian country</a>, his defense of Khodorkovsky also aims not at defending his client legally, but at using his case to undermine and ultimately overturn the leadership of Russia. It is done in a concerted effort with the US State Department, the corporate media, and a vast network of US and European subsidized NGOs sowing sedition within Russia itself.

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.khodorkovskycenter.com/" target="_blank">khodorkovskycenter.com</a>

<strong>2. Neo-Conservatives Attempting to Encircle Russia with NATO</strong>

The Neo-Conservative Foreign Policy Initiative, whose membership has helped engineer and promote every war in at least the last 30 years of American history, clearly enumerates what it believes <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.foreignpolicyi.org/content/fpi-analysis-moving-beyond-us-russian-%E2%80%9Creset%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">the next steps the US should take toward Russia should be</a>. These include continuing the encirclement of Russia with NATO and its controversial "missile defense" efforts, continuing to build up the Republic of Georgia as a menacing proxy-threat lying on Russia's borders, and "supporting human rights" focusing on the "Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2011" which seeks yet again to sanction members of the Russian government based on disingenuous "human rights" concerns, <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/06/pnac-reborn-calling-for-greater-libyan.html">just as the FPI and its collaborators did in Libya</a><a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/06/pnac-reborn-calling-for-greater-libyan.html">. </a>

<a href="http://www.foreignpolicyi.org/about/staff">Foreign Policy Initiative's Board of Directors </a>
<a href="http://www.foreignpolicyi.org/content/fpi-analysis-moving-beyond-us-russian-%E2%80%9Creset%E2%80%9D">FPI Analysis: Moving Beyond the U.S.-Russian “Reset”</a>

<strong>3. The Henry Jackson Foundation, NED, Alexey Navalny, &amp; Ilya Yashin</strong>

We'll keep hearing the name Alexey Navalny until the fact that he is fully subsidized by the US State Department through the National Endowment for Democracy is widely exposed, and <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/12/egypt-elbaradei-outed-by-own-movement_02.html">like Egypt's Mohamed ElBaradei</a>, cast aside as extra-baggage.

The first clue comes to us from the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/michaelweiss/100122578/how-alexey-navalny-is-changing-putins-russia/" target="_blank">London, Telegraph who afforded column space to a Mr. Michael Weiss</a> of the Henry Jackson Society, providing a very robust defense for Navalny and his efforts to expose "corruption" during Russia's election. And while Weiss does his best to fend off accusations that Navalny is indeed a foreign agent, calling such accusations "adorably old-fashioned," he fails to point out that, again, the NGOs and poll monitors accusing Russia of rigging the elections, and whom "activists" like Navalny continuously cite as evidence, are all funded by the very US and European governments conducting the NATO military encirclement of Russia.

The background of Weiss' Henry Jackson Foundation should surprise no one. Its <a href="http://www.hmjackson.org/downloads/annual_report_05.pdf">corporate-sponsors include (page 18)</a> Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, IBM, General Dynamics, State Farm, and Xerox, while "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.blogger.com/www.henryjacksonsociety.org/signatories.asp?pageid=36" target="_blank">signatories" of its "statement of principles</a>" include current and former members of the British Government, members of the <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/03/naming-names-your-real-government.html">corporate-financier sponsored Chatham House</a>, and professors throughout British academia.

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.henryjacksonsociety.org/content.asp?pageid=37" target="_blank">International patrons</a> include Neo-Con Max Boot - Michael Chertoff - <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.ned.org/about/board/meet-our-president" target="_blank">Carl Gershman president of NED</a> - Israeli Ambassador Dore Gold - FPI, Brookings Institute, and PNAC signatory Robert Kagan - Max Kampelman, also a PNAC signatory - Neo-Con William Kristol of the above mentioned FPI and also a PNAC signatory - <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.defenddemocracy.org/media-hit/fdd-president-clifford-may-nominated-to-serve-on-broadcasting-board-of-gove/" target="_blank">Clifford May</a> of the Neo-Con Foundations for the Defense of Democracies (FDD) - Neo-Con Richard Perle - former-NATO commander General Jack Sheehan - and Neo-Con warmonger James Woolsey, formally of the CIA and a leading proponent for war with Iran.

One must be forgiven for doubting the genuine resolve of the Henry Jackson Foundation's commitment toward human rights and democracy, since those they associate with have single-handledly done more to exterminate such ideals from our collective human conscience than any other group of villains combined. Their association with Carl Gershman, president of NED who is on record funding NGOs like Golos in Russia, not only write off any legitimacy they portray themselves as having, but also begin to cast serious suspicion on Alexey Navalny whom they are so vigorously defending.

And while Alexey Navalny is renowned for "exposing corruption," at least when profitable, those researching his background begin unraveling his own insidious, compromised agenda. Alexey Navalny <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.yale.edu/worldfellows/fellows/navalny.html" target="_blank">was a Yale World Fellow</a>, and in his profile it states:
<blockquote>"Navalny spearheads legal challenges on behalf of minority shareholders in large Russian companies, including Gazprom, Bank VTB, Sberbank, Rosneft, Transneft, and Surgutneftegaz, through the Union of Minority Shareholders. He has successfully forced companies to disclose more information to their shareholders and has sued individual managers at several major corporations for allegedly corrupt practices. Navalny is also co-founder of the Democratic Alternative movement and was vice-chairman of the Moscow branch of the political party YABLOKO. In 2010, he launched RosPil, a public project funded by unprecedented fundraising in Russia. In 2011, Navalny started RosYama, which combats fraud in the road construction sector."</blockquote>
The Democratic Alternative, also written DA!, is indeed a National Endowment for Democracy fund recipient, meaning that Alexey Navalny is an agent of US-funded sedition and willfully hiding it from his followers. The <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://cablegate.at/cables/06MOSCOW12709" target="_blank">US State Department itself reveals this</a> as they list "youth movements" operating in Russia:
<blockquote>"DA!: Mariya Gaydar, daughter of former Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, leads DA! (Democratic Alternative). She is ardent in her promotion of democracy, but realistic about the obstacles she faces. Gaydar said that DA! is focused on non-partisan activities designed to raise political awareness. She has received funding from the National Endowment for Democracy, a fact she does not publicize for fear of appearing compromised by an American connection."</blockquote>
Alexey was involved directly in founding a movement funded by the US government and to this day has the very people who funded DA! defending him throughout Western media. The mention of co-founder Mariya Gaydar is also revealing, as she has long collaborated, and occasionally has been arrested with, Ilya Yashin, yet another leader of a NED-funded Russian "activist" opposition group.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17818" title="wallstreet_vs_russia" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/wallstreet_vs_russia.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="171" /><em>Photo: Alexei Navalny, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.blogger.com/www.yale.edu/worldfellows/fellows/navalny.html" target="_blank">Yale World Fellow</a> and co-founder of US National Endowment for Democracy Da! or "Democratic Alternative/Yes in Russian." It is yet another <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/02/cia-coup-college.html" target="_blank">Otpor-esque</a> organization courtesy of the United States government and willful traitors to their motherland.</em>

Ilya Yashin leads the Moscow branch of the People's Freedom Party and is a leading member of the "Strategy 31" campaign, which claims to be fighting for the freedom of assembly. Unfortunately, Strategy 31's ranks are filled with activists trained and coordinated by US NED-funded NGOs. From the official <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.ned.org/where-we-work/eurasia/russia" target="_blank">NED.org website</a> we find:
<div>
<blockquote><strong>"Moscow Group of Assistance in the Implementation of the Helsinki Accords</strong><em> $50,000</em>.
To draw greater attention to the issue of freedom of assembly in Russia and to the “Strategy 31” movement, which seeks to protect this fundamental right. The organization will train a network of regional activists and coordinate their activities through mini-seminars and field visits, and conduct an information cam­paign through press conferences, posters, and educational handouts pertaining to freedom of assembly, to be distributed to the general public by regional partners."</blockquote>
This is also confirmed in NED's "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.demdigest.net/blog/2011/02/russias-strategy-31-a-sign-of-civil-societys-resilience/" target="_blank">Democracy Digest</a>" where the "Moscow Helsinki Group" is explicitly stated as leading Strategy 31 marches and that the group is a "long-time grantee of the National Endowment of Democracy."

Worst yet, Yashin's People's Freedom Party is lined not with aspiring youth seeking "freedom" for the Russian people, but rather lined with career politicians and businessmen collaborating with foreign-interests. Among them is <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.wmd.org/about/steering-committee/vladimir-ryzhkov" target="_blank">Vladimir Ryzhkov</a>, a member of the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.wmd.org/about" target="_blank">NED-funded, Washington-based</a> World Movement for Democracy. There is also Boris Nemtsov whose adviser, Vladimir Kara-Murza (of Solidarnost) recently took part in a September 14, 2011 NED-sponsored event titled, "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.ned.org/events/elections-in-russia-polling-and-perspectives" target="_blank">Elections in Russia: Polling and Perspectives</a>" where they used a NED-funded polling organization, the "Levada Center," to project "winners" in upcoming elections and study the Manezh riots of 2010 - for now obvious reasons as the US attempts to fan the flames of unrest across Russia.

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.wmd.org/about/steering-committee/vladimir-ryzhkov" target="_blank">Vladimir Ryzhkov's World Movement for Democracy Profile</a>

<strong>4. Freedom House</strong>

Rounding off the list is Freedom House, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=265#7" target="_blank">a US government-funded</a> subsidiary of the National Endowment for Democracy. President of Freedom House, David Kramer, a minion under the Bush administration, recently wrote "<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.npr.org/2011/12/08/143343061/foreign-policy-now-hear-this-moscow" target="_blank">Now Hear This, Moscow</a>."

In his piece he notes that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton "unambiguously stood with those who protested against Vladimir Putin and his party of power, United Russia, both in the voting booth and on the streets of Moscow on Monday and Tuesday." Between Kramer's Freedom House, NED who clearly has funded and supported, if not entirely created the current Russian opposition, and indeed Clinton's "unambiguous" stand with the mobs in the streets, it is very easy to see why Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Putin+accuses+fomenting+protest/5835807/story.html" target="_blank">accused the US of interfering in Russia's sovereign internal affairs</a>.

Kramer would go on by citing the Organization for Security and Cooperation OSCE poll monitors - funded by various nations, UN funds, and strangely enough Soros' Open Society, Statoil, and USAID (<a href="http://www.osce.org/sg/76315">page 125</a>) - and his "concerns" over the alleged harassment of <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.ned.org/where-we-work/eurasia/russia" target="_blank">US NED-funded Golos</a>. As usual, faux-human rights crusaders like Kramer who intentionally destabilize nations and foment unrest, then claim any measure taken by the targeted nation to defend itself is an abuse of "human rights" and "freedom," an all too familiar narrative that has played out from <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/11/soros-celebrates-fall-of-tunisia.html">Tunisia</a> to <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/11/exposing-wall-streets-human-rights.html">Thailand</a>, from <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/11/syria-nato-genocide-approaches.html">Syria</a> to <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/11/burmese-pro-democracy-movement-creation.html">Myanmar</a>.

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=1533" target="_blank">Another Freedom House statement</a>, provided on their own website, again calls for the "Sergei Magnitsky Act" to leverage their false claims of human rights abuses to sanction and begin bringing down Russia's leadership. The statement is signed off not by noted humanitarians, but by notorious Neo-Cons Eric Edelman, Jamie Fly, Robert Kagan, Kramer himself, and Stephen Rademaker, a corporate lobbyist <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/12/clinton-turns-to-naked-corporate.html">at the notorious Podesta Group</a> and a "foreign policy adviser" <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romney-taps-foreign-policy-national-security-advisers/2011/10/06/gIQAnDHzPL_story_2.html" target="_blank">for Mitt Romney</a>.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

It is quite clear that the National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, the Foreign Policy Initiative, and even the US State Department <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/12/clinton-turns-to-naked-corporate.html">whose new foreign affairs advisory board</a> is full of think-tanks representing overt corporate-financier interests, are not interested in "democracy," "human rights," or "freedom" in Russia, but rather removing the Kremlin out of the way, and reestablishing the parasitic feeding on the Russian people and its economy they enjoyed after the fall of the Soviet Union.

The Kremlin is definitely fighting fire with fire; however they are doing so on their own sovereign soil against foreign interests disingenuously masquerading behind the ideals of Western civilization. The mobs polluting the streets of Russia, while consisting of well-intentioned folks, are being led by willful liars who are on record covering up their foreign-funding knowing full well their "legitimacy" will be compromised should it be made public. After what Wall Street and London have done in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, and in nation after nation as it expands its vast empire, why should any organization taking funds from these people to destabilize and overthrow their own country retain any semblance of legitimacy?

And while NED and other corporate-funded foundations execute this policy of meddling in Russia's affairs, it is Wall Street and London, the largest banking, oil, defense contracting, and industrial interests on Earth that are producing the policy. They do so via a network of think-tanks they themselves fund. It is essential that we understand <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/03/naming-names-your-real-government.html">who these corporations are</a>, <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/03/naming-names-your-real-government.html">boycott them out of business</a>, and begin <a href="http://landdestroyer.blogspot.com/2011/03/globalists-worst-nightmare.html" target="_blank">replacing them entirely</a> as a society. If they can meddle and cause chaos in the streets of a large, nuclear armed super power, what threat do they pose to average people, their families, and communities?

<em>Indian girls are set on fire because the husband or his family consider that the dowry she brings with her into marriage is not large enough.</em>

<strong>Pravda.Ru interview conducted by</strong>
<strong> Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>

Love. Youth. Marriage. Burning, suicide, death. Welcome to India’s dowry killings. Yes, still in the twenty-first century Indian girls can be, and are, set on fire or forced to suicide because the husband or his family consider that the dowry she brings with her into marriage is not large enough.

Pravda.Ru interviewed Sheba Rakesh, Executive Director of Pankh, a Women’s Empowerment Organization operating in India, and part of the Safe World for Women Campaign.

<strong>How important is the dowry in India in social and economic terms? And how come brides can be killed because of it?</strong>

A: In the Indian social set up, dowry or ‘dahej’ holds a rather important place. Simply stated it refers to the goods, wealth (moveable and immoveable) that a girl takes with her to the groom’s household when she gets married.

The entire idea originated in the fact that earlier, women did not enjoy any inheritance rights in the paternal property. It was the male heir that stood to gain in the event of the parents’ transferral of property/ death or any other such event. Since the rights were not equal the Indian culture (as well as that of other civilisations in the world) made it mandatory that the girl get a part of the father’s legacy through what she carried with her at the time of marriage.

Gradually it came to signify the “Love” that parents had for their daughter and eventually the system succumbed to the growing greed in a consumerist society where instead of the emotional bonding between the families involved in the marital alliance, what came to matter was the amount of wealth she could bring with her. Since, these business negotiations like everything else have a shelf life; the exhaustion of dowry rings the trouble bell for the woman in question.

Sometimes, the problems can assume uncontrollable proportions, where the opposite party is not satisfied with the dowry that the girl has brought with her, it makes sure that the new member of the family is not accepted. The most miserable of all these situations is the collusion of the husband where because of the lack of personal interest or adhering to false notions of honour and ego, the relationship is not given the due importance and the woman continues to pay the price in terms of her poor existence and sometimes even her life.

You see, this is an extremely complex issue... and the human psychology and brains are at work... insecurities can wreak havoc with human relationships... we have cases where the brides have been driven to suicide or have been brutally killed. Apart from the fact that the groom and his family are to be blatantly blamed, it also has to do with the rigid social mentality where a woman’s life is considered to be a waste in case the marriage fails to work. The social stigmas, the failure to respect individual identities and more importantly, the women’s failure to appreciate their self-worth are reasons as to why lives come to desperate ends. Pseudo notions of honour, sexuality and the neat “dos and donts” wreak havoc... society wins... lives lose...

In a nutshell the entire issue is about a radical shift in priorities -- money over love and emotional well-being!

<strong>Do the groom’s families have to contribute anything to the dowry?</strong>

A: No, nothing in material terms... just huge amounts of greed.

<strong>How is it possible that such a barbaric practice is carried out?</strong>

A: As I said earlier, there isn’t any fixed set of rules to perpetrate tortures. In most cases the brides are burnt alive, in yet some of the others the emotional, financial and psychological torture is so intense that the girl, finding herself emotionally alone, is driven to despair and ultimately suicide. Apart from the social and psychological behaviour of close ones that encourages such behaviour it is the legal problems that force women to see nothing but a dead end... and this despite the fact that the law has quite some options to help the women in dire times. Also, with the increase in greed these crimes and associated criminal mindsets and activities (considering the girl child a burden and female foeticide) are increasing by the hour.

In some places in India, the bride is injected with poison so that she dies a silent death and the relatives escape scot-free in the absence of sufficient evidence. In some cases Silence is the biggest killer. Also, as long as the social mentality associates the existence of a woman as that of a commodity the exploitation will continue. Sometimes, it is the parents themselves who pride themselves at being able to conduct these negotiations aptly, failing to understand that it is a big folly to assume that the girl will be “happy” if sent across to live taking huge money with her... when they should realise what is the big deal in buying a man for their daughter when like everything else, commodities do not last long... and that she can be better off without such selfish relationships in her life...

<strong>Could you explain what sort of legal loopholes facilitate this horrific behaviour? What other factors are involved in creating a scenario whereby dowry killings can take place?</strong>

A: The legal loopholes are not as many in terms of provision as they are on the level of implementation. Although, here I would like to state that in terms of the provisions also where there is the Anti-Dowry Act of the Indian Penal Code (section 498 A), Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961( Sections 3, 4,4A) and Section 304 B of the IPC regarding dowry deaths, there are within these sections some good areas which provide a lot of breathing space to the accused party.

Besides, not very many such victimised parties have the courage and the resources to pursue their cases persistently. Odd as it may sound, sometimes a lot has to be faced before the crime can finally be registered. Oftentimes, it is the legal system that comes to the rescue and helps the victim fight the corruption of the system before actually the case becomes a legal reality. In case of interstate crimes and breaches of marital trust, the parties may end up losing too much time because of the factors influencing the dispensing of justice. Oftentimes, this becomes a tussle of power between the parties involved rather than being straightforward cases demanding justice... and this precisely can be one of the factors that encourages such crimes to be perpetrated time and again.

One of the ‘other’ major factors that help in creating a scenario for facilitating these horrific killings is the continual silence that tends to creep into relationships when crime is just about knocking at your doorstep.<em> Pankh</em> had been following this case sub judice at the court of law where the dead victim’s parents have been fighting a case under section 304 B of the IPC; where they still refuse to come out in the open and comment about whatever went wrong with their daughter for fears that are absolutely individual in nature. It is to be noted that the victim had called her father before the gruesome incident and asked him to take her back, something which he failed to do and the sorry incident happened; personally I would not blame this party, because they have a younger daughter to be married off and they are blatantly scared that the “talk” would ruin her prospects of her marriage, so much for the desire for justice in the current social situations – despite the crime being non-bailable and cognisable under law the accused has been granted bail against an appeal in the higher court... and then there are debates in the country on the misuse of the dowry laws – these examples and incidents only tend to make the situation more serious.

<strong>How widespread is dowry killing?</strong>

A: Throughout the world these negotiations exist in some form or the other, yet according to a UN report it is just South Asia where dowry leads to deaths. Dowry being a business negotiation, woven around an emotional alliance... the breach of trust is assuming alarming proportions with every passing day... Dowry is safely touted as the biggest killer of women in India... and this within a relationship that is supposed to guarantee her social security and protection! Where such killings are not huge, dowry still remains a huge motivating factor for other crimes such as female foeticide, human trafficking, prostitution and most of all, loss of human dignity. The social cost of allowing such systems to exist is huge.

<strong>Could we conclude that if dowry killings are rife in India and that brides are driven to suicide or are murdered often with impunity, then women’s rights per se do not exist in India?</strong>

A: This question again has a not so simple explanation to it. As I said, rights do exist but the implementation is at fault. The eradication of any social evil requires an active inbuilt participation from within the society, something that is still not forthcoming from the average Indian household. Thinking about women’s rights and the way they are handled at personal, social, organisational and administrative levels needs even today to undergo a drastic change before something worthwhile can be achieved. I do believe that sorority cannot always spell magic if vested interests continue to rule the roost at the organisational level. This stands true to Women’s issues also... however the times are transitional and women are gradually learning to face these issues but we still have miles to go...

...women are raped and turned out in the name of marriage... or bonds are severed after years of marriage with the woman without any financial resources unto herself... yes Timothy, we have miles to go...

<strong>The Indian Government passed the Dowry Prohibition Act fifty years ago in 1961, which made the demands for dowries in wedding arrangements illegal. However, half a century on, there are reports that there are still thousands of such incidents every year. Is that figure realistic?</strong>

A: Unfortunately yes! As I said we are still waiting for the generation of true awareness in the masses. Like everything this needs a huge effort on our part... we need women to appreciate the value of independence as much they appreciate the value of relationships in life and most importantly we need more men to be aware of this delicate issue... again a huge effort.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Pakistani Press Praises Iran&#039;s Courage in Confrontation with US</title>

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17877" title="iran-us-drone" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iran-us-drone-500x281.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" />
<em>The Pakistani press Lauded Tehran's downing of a highly advanced US drone earlier this month, and said Tehran's response to the US move set the example of a courageous nation.</em>

Pakistan's newspaper Nation cited FNA's December 9 report citing Iranian MP Esmaeil Kowsari as saying that if the United States' spy drone, which was recently downed by the Iranian armed forces in eastern country, had been a jet fighter, the conditions in the region would have changed by now.

Here is the article in the Nation:

In an interview with FNA on Friday, Kowsari, who is the Vice-Chairman of the Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Commission, said, "In that case, Iran would have pounded all US military bases across the world."

My dear, these are the voices of a free people; free from the hegemony of the West and tyranny of the Aristocrats of the Shah's Era. But it requires some guts and intelligence as well; mere babbling and bickering will not suffice. Iran has proved that they can not only defy the Western hegemony, but also display it by actions based on resolve and pragmatism; it is also a shut up call to the Western sponsored pseudo-intellectuals and fear-mongers, who keep reminding us of the doomsday scenario, even if you think of contesting the West based on principles.

The Iranian security forces have been monitoring the US drone campaign in Pakistan very carefully, besides constantly monitoring the US spy drone flights violating their air space. A team of young experts (I will not call them cyber warriors, as they were defending their air space) had kept working for days and sleepless nights to develop a response that should give them an upper edge in case of a showdown with the US-led "coalition of the unwilling."

Iran Daily describes the whole saga as: "The drone utilized the top technologies available to the US army and intelligence services. Those aware of hackers and their abilities know that hacking a website or network is like a raindrop compared to hacking satellites controlling this kind of spy planes. The plane was designed to fly on SAT orders from initiation base. If for any reason contact with the initiation base - in this case, Afghanistan - was lost it should respond to the orders given by another base in the US. If contact with both the bases is lost, then it should return immediately to the initial base. If it cannot, self-destruction is the ultimate choice. Despite this, the Iranian electronic war hackers were not only able to hack the SAT controlling the drone and sever contacts with the Afghanistan base, but they were also able to simulate their base as the US base for the plane and as the higher ranking base forced the plane to land without destroying itself, the artificial intelligent-based software did not even suspect that it is being controlled by the Iranian forces."

"For the information of those who are not acquainted with hacking, a website or network may require a hacker to pass through 1 to 16 gates at most for highly sophisticated financial networks. Opening each gate does not necessitate coming back to opening it again. However, hacking a stealth spy plane may need crossing about 255 gates, which will all be reset each time the opening of any of the previous gates fail. That means that a hacker should start all over again, if for any reason he fails to open one of the gates. This means hacking such a sophisticated system is nearly impossible. But the Iranian hackers did it."

"Hacking such an extremely sophisticated system, which until last week was considered impossible, means that the Iranians are able to enter all computer-based network systems in the US and Europe. Since the algorithm and logic behind other systems are much simpler, the Iranians may be able to control all radars, satellites, planes, ships, tanks, rockets, cruise missiles and so on of the US and NATO throughout the world. They may be able to even control American soldiers, who are driven to fight using satellite controlled infrared systems."

Anytime and anywhere they wish. By taking control of this plane, the Iranians will be able to 'reverse engineer' the drone and produce their own planes. That means the Iranians will be the next to have this kind of high sophisticated technology in the world."

Proudly describing the role of Iranian military, the Iran Daily goes on: "This plane was not detected by radar, but by intelligence agents, who informed the Iranian forces of the entry of the aircraft into their air space to gather information. This means that Iranian intelligence is powerful enough to intercept top US military and CIA intelligence services, which are capable of gathering vital information."

"In addition, the information was placed at the disposal of the Iranian military so swiftly that the IRGC had time to get ready to take control of the plane. In view of this, the US administration has to think twice and begin overhauling its intelligence services. Such a weak intelligence service could spell disaster for its soldiers in the area. If the Iranians are able to obtain highly-confidential information, they may be also able to access other secret information."

"This incident proves that the Americans have underestimated the capabilities of Iranian military and intelligence services. By penetrating the American systems, the Iranians have proved that they are also capable of accessing other systems, including those of the Israelis that may be much easier since even the Lebanese Hezbollah was able to infringe Israeli networks on many occasions. This means that if for any reason a scenario of attacking any base in Iran should be implemented, the weapons can be deflected back to the perpetrators simply by hacking their systems."

"Pakistan may learn from the Iranian example in dealing with the menace of drones, as well as the growing and threatening posture of the US-led NATO. The Iranians have hunted the hunter at the most appropriate time for Pakistan. If the NATO and US are becoming hostile towards Pakistan and Iran, then common sense calls for a strategic alliance between both targeted nations. Let the doomsday phobic experts and dollar fed intellectuals within Pakistan keep finding one reason after the other to support this godforsaken long war, and let the public decide what is good for Pakistan and Iran."]]></content:encoded>

[caption id="attachment_17835" align="alignnone" width="430" caption="Islamabad has tacitly consented to the covert US drone campaign, which many Pakistanis see as a violation of their country&#39;s sovereignty."]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SHAMSI-AIR-BASE.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17835" title="SHAMSI AIR BASE" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/SHAMSI-AIR-BASE.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="318" /></a>[/caption]

<em>American military evacuates base widely believed to have been hub for covert CIA drone war after last month's NATO air strike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers</em>

The United States is evacuating a Pakistani air base following orders from the military incensed by a deadly NATO raid on its border that left 24 of its soldiers dead, officials said.

Pakistan's top command ordered the US out of Shamsi air base in the wake of the 26 November bombing. The base is widely understood to have been a hub for the covert CIA drone war on Taliban and Al-Qaeda commanders in the northwest.

US Ambassador to Islamabad Cameron Munter told a Pakistan television channel on Monday: "We are complying with the request."

The deadline for the removal of all US personnel and equipment from the base in the remote southwestern province of Baluchistan was set for 11 December.

"They are evacuating the base; evacuation is in the process," confirmed a senior Pakistani government official in Islamabad.

"Pakistan has provided security to them (Americans) on the Shamsi air base and we will withdraw that security from the date we have given for withdrawal, so they have no other option but to evacuate it," the official said.

Islamabad has so far refused to take part in a US investigation into the deadly air strikes on the Afghan border.

In the wake of the strikes, Pakistan decided not to take part in the Bonn Conference on the future of Afghanistan, which, along with the Taliban's boycott, cast doubt on any hopes of using the meetings to pursue a peace settlement.

Pakistan has also shut down a key NATO supply line into Afghanistan along with its order for American personnel to leave Shamsi air base.

US President Barack Obama on Sunday expressed condolences to Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari for the soldier deaths and said the NATO airstrikes that killed them were not a "deliberate attack."

But the incident has plunged relations between Washington and its counterterrorism ally Islamabad to a new nadir, although officials say neither country can afford a complete break in relations.

US officials and intelligence analysts have said the covert drone war would not be affected by closure of the base as Washington could fly Predator and Reaper drones out of air fields in neighbouring Afghanistan.

But the Shamsi air base is supposed to be particularly useful for flights hampered by poor weather conditions.

Islamabad has tacitly consented to the covert US drone campaign, which many Pakistanis see as a violation of their country's sovereignty.]]></content:encoded>

<em>Federico Dal Cortivo interviews Joe Fallisi, Italian tenor and human rights activist. Fallisi has denounced the Italian government over the war against Libya.</em>

<strong>Translated from Italian by Alexander Synge</strong>

<strong>Q:</strong> Mr. Fallisi, on Thursday 27 October, you filed a charge at the Public Prosecutor’s office in Rome against the State of Italy for having violated Art. 11 of the Constitution by engaging in “hostilities against a foreign State”. This decision is, I think, counter-current, since all the parties in parliament and the Chief of State, Napolitano, fully support the NATO war. How did you reach it?

<strong>A:</strong> I came to the conclusion that it was my duty as a citizen to oppose this infamous development in Italy’s history. We find here the blackest page in the chronicles of recent years. I feel I am not represented in any way either by the government or by the opposition. Or by the so-called “President of the Republic”, an old hand in the Stalinist, Atlantic, Freemasonry camp, always ready to shed (radioactive) crocodile tears whenever the occasion requires it. You’re right, Parliament has “fully supported” the predatory assault on Libya willed by the Euro-American usurocrats. The decision to tear up a vital article of the constitution was taken by all, alongside the vile decision not to honour the treaty which was to bind us in friendship with the Great Arab Libyan People’s Socialist Jamahiriya. Again, the centre-right-left Caste has removed its mask, providing us with yet another reason for a revolution which one day shall rid us of them all.

<strong>Q:</strong> The attack on Libya was justified by France, Great Britain and the USA as “humanitarian intervention”, required to save the lives of civilians. What’s your view on this? What were the real reasons behind the war (never actually declared) which so closely resembles the war against Serbia in 1999?

<strong>A:</strong> The sages of India would say we are up to our necks in the era of Kali Yuga, a time in which power is in the hands of brutality (introductory information can be found in the three eloquent sections “Problemi che sorgono nel Kali Yuga”, “Cambiamenti nelle persone” and “Condizioni delle caste” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga" target="_blank">here</a>). Add to this the fact that we live in the society of spectres, <em>Ersatz</em>, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629511" target="_blank">Big Brother</a> and Total Propaganda. The voice of those in power is the voice of falsehood. By definition, everything is placed on its head. The wielders of power use the most invasive media, which serve them, which are capable of palming off lies of gigantic, global proportions as though they were real. Just as we saw, for example, with the willing serfs in America who swallowed both the ridiculous elections (which Bush actually lost but which we are told he won) and Bush’s successor − who received his Nobel peace prize just before embarking on a career as warmonger (not only that, since he wasn’t born in one of the States of the Union, he wasn’t even entitled to run for the election). We see it in the targeted assassination of Bin Laden’s ghost − the spectral spectacle par excellence (see <a href="http://it.groups.yahoo.com/group/libertari/message/88853" target="_blank">here</a>)! To justify their crimes they take refuge in the doubtful criteria of political correctness, of democratic mystification (see vol. I of Qaddafi’s <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theory/gb1.htm" target="_blank">Green Book</a>). It goes without saying that these people are about as interested in saving “civilian” lives as vampires are in the health of their… patients. They are the worst foes of the freedoms of peoples and true human rights. If more proof were needed, look at the obscene attack on the Jamahiriya − which by the way, before the “Islamic” monsters and northern Atlantic terrorists wreaked their havoc, had ensured living standards of the first order. Ask the martyred people of Sirte what kind of “protection” they received (along with phosphorus, uranium and anthrax – see, for instance, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCj5EMC8RG4&amp;feature=channel_video_title" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.uruknet.de/?s1=3&amp;p=82685&amp;s2=31" target="_blank">here</a>).

Anglo-Judeo-America (a term I use for all predatory countries of the North and the West of the world) is made up of countries in the hands of Shylock (the supranational banking and financial power behind the Federal Reserve, the IMF and ECB). Anglo-Judeo-America will soon be insolvent. The empire is in a state of decline, in each and every sense of the word. Bolstering it we find only media manipulations and lethal arms, which the empire increasingly feels it can use at will. It is a well-known fact that when capitalism dies, it can rise from the grave again if the corpse is infused once more with the breath of life. That breath of life is called War. However, the old solution can only work when the economy, the means of production and the body of society display at least some signs of health, but now we face only advanced decay. We are watching the zombies as they walk over the edge of a cliff. Disaster has become inevitable.

If you think about it, the (still timid) emerging powers (BRIC, Venezuela…), with substantially healthy economies, or economies which are healing, have no need for war − except in defence. Perhaps Russia and China will actually have to defend themselves. And soon. While the war against Africa (on so many fronts) is directed toward crushing sovereign nations in order to devour their marrow (just look at Iraq, and the clear parallels with the situation in Libya), geopolitically and strategically we also see that it’s a war directed against Russia and China.

<strong>Q:</strong> Do you know if NATO used bombs containing Depleted Uranium during the heavy airstrikes on Tripoli and other Libyan cities? A <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.9online.it" target="_blank">recent study by Massimo Zucchetti</a>, a nuclear technology teacher at the <em>Politecnico</em> in Turin, states that “there is discussion over the impact on Libya’s environment of arms containing DU, particularly Tomahawk cruise missiles with DU warheads, and that, according a worst case scenario, we can plausibly reckon on an increase in the incidence of tumours of about 6,200 cases per year for the next 70 years. It has been calculated that 112 missiles were launched on the first day of the war and it is more than likely that 1,000 or so had been launched before the war ended.”

<strong>A:</strong> There can be no doubt that the bloodthirsty “willing” predators (including shameless Italy) dumped an enormous quantity of bombs onto the soil of Libya (more than the quantity used during WWII). Most warheads included depleted uranium (or enriched uranium, see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd6ix6swkXs&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">here</a>). After all, that’s how today’s democracy works. A crime has been committed not only against humanity but also against Mother Nature. What shall we do with our nuclear waste? The best thing is to use it for arms to make high-penetration missiles. Best not to waste anything. Translating into permanent injury for today’s ‘flavour of the month’ bad guys (as I pointed out in an earlier interview, the harm is practically eternal). Plus the advantage that it costs nothing to transfer the uranium from the waste deposits. Returning to Kali Yuga, I’d like to point to certain key aspects of the dark age we live in. “‘Civilized’ warfare (with its codes of conduct and honour precisely set forth) is a thing of the past. Men fight like the Asuras and Rakshasas. As opposed to the other Yugas, who would cease their fighting from sunset to dawn, cremate the fallen and meditate upon war, the fighters of the era of Kali do not stop. Their only concern is final victory. Sadism becomes more marked. (...) The kshatriyas, the regal, warrior caste, is corrupted (…); their chiefs become rogues, criminals and terrorists. They try to use their remaining power to exploit the people: the kings themselves become thieves who will steal from their subjects rather than protect and defend them”. The fact that the State “warriors” (mercenaries) of the present day are also (unhealthy) carriers of this radioactive plague seems to accord well, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, with the picture I have just painted. As for the costs of war, these costs are to be paid for precisely by the country that has been invaded and destroyed, plus the interest imposed by the loan sharks. The oil is used for this purpose too (see Iraq). The North Atlantic Terrorist Organization has just told the cutthroat-breast murderers of Benghazi (news - 17:00, 30 October 2011 – see <a href="http://libyasos.blogspot.com/p/news.html" target="_blank">Libya S.O.S.</a>) that (at present) the costs of the war come to 480,000,000 dollars. Who knows whether the sum includes interest or not? Probably not.

<strong>Q:</strong> Geopolitically speaking, the attack on Libya shows just how determined the United States and its allies are to create an enduring escalation of warfare in the area of the Mediterranean and Near East, clearly with a view to destabilising all who do not bend to what the Latin Americans balefully call “Washington’s will”. We’ve recently heard from observers, including Russia’s envoy to NATO, Dmitry Rogozin, that Libya will be followed by Syria and Iran. Can you give us your thoughts on this?

<strong>A:</strong> For at least a decade, Syria and Iran (by the way, Iran is a tougher ‘nut’ to crack…) have also been in the sights of the Washington-London-Tel Aviv globalists (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUhlFO5qjVE" target="_blank">here</a>). As for Syria, an NTC has already been formed, also known as CNT (by a macabre coincidence of history CNT was the acronym for the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists). The NTC was constituted in Turkey, a faithful ally of Washington, and Turkey is one of the backstabbing Muslim States responsible for the rape of Libya. Erdogan, again, reveals his fake-Islamic <em>dönme</em> identity. Those who believe he might be the new <em>condottiero</em> of a new Ottoman empire and of a renewed Islam in the Middle East will just have to think again. His anti-Zionism is false (he obliged the Mavi Marmara to raise the flag of Comoros, not the Turkish flag, just before it set sail from Istanbul as part of the 2010 Freedom Flotilla. Erdogan played a key role in aborting Freedom Flotilla II, already foundering as a result of the “aid” received from Qatar. His conduct is yet another instance of the twisted representation of reality that characterises our society-of-all-that-is-spectral. And the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629137" target="_blank">Turks are waking up</a> to this state of affairs. The lords of chaos could do to Turkey, with its Kurdish minority, what they’ve done to Libya and what they’re planning to do to Syria. He who lives by the sword…

<strong>Q:</strong> From the military angle, during the operations, “Operation Odyssey Dawn and Unified Protector”, which began with the French <em>Armée de l’Air</em>’s surprise attack on 19 March, the NATO coalition was flanked by Arab aircraft. To be more precise, Qatar with six Mirage 2000-5EDA and DDA aircraft and the United Arab Emirates with 12 aircraft (Mirage 2000-9 EAD/DAD and F16E/F). This basically means that a part of the Arab world, too, came out against Qaddafi − which is something we already saw during the Gulf War. What’s your take on this Arab participation?

<strong>A:</strong> Yes. The Anglo-Judeo-American predators are carving up Libya together with key Arab and Islamic countries (excepting Syria and Algeria, both threatened), and with the practically full support of the Palestinian resistance organizations. It is, actually, a tragedy within the tragedy, and the most squalid chapter in their recent history. As we were saying, it goes deeper than just the monarcho-theocratic Gulf dictatorships (<a href="http://alfatah69.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/the-role-of-qatari-troops-in-the-so-called-libyan-revolution/" target="_blank">led by Qatar, whose boots-on-the-ground actions were decisive</a>). These dictatorships sold out long ago to America and are <em>de facto</em> collaborators of the Zionist entity. Iran, too, cheered as they watched the nauseating spectacle of Qaddafi’s lynching. Iran’s Minister of Defence says he’s keen to work together with the Muslim Brotherhood’s Egypt, the oppressor Egyptian army and<a href="http://www.uruknet.de/?s1=3&amp;p=82689&amp;s2=31" target="_blank"> the Al-Qa‘ida filth in Benghazi</a>. Hezbollah’s Lebanon dances to the same tune and, from the start, has been a key player in spreading Al-Jewzeera and Al-Arabiya’s colossal lies, and demanding a “no-fly zone”, i.e. an imperialistic attack on yet another Arab country. And, sadly, even the Palestinians (Hamas, Islamic Jihad, PFLP…) have been crying for Libya’s blood. This is a particularly shameless act of betrayal, after the unceasing support of Qaddafi’s Libya for their cause, with no underhand dealings with the enemy whatsoever. The Jamahiriya − which respected and practised the fundamentals of the Koran − was considered by its theocratic foes overly non-religious. The great Qaddafi had always considered, and has always defended, management of the common good as the task of the masses, self-organised as people’s committees, curbing the priestly rabble, with their tyrannical ways, as well as foreign meddling. The fundamental rights that all Libyan citizens enjoyed under the Jamahiriya, including, especially, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629271" target="_blank">women’s rights</a>, were incomparably greater than you’ll find in any other Muslim State. It was the battle conducted to safeguard the Jamahiriya against a reactionary minority − and Nasser first, and Saddam afterwards, were to conduct the same battle. As for the (atheistic, materialistic and dictatorial) groups of Trotskyite-Stalinist origin, their hatred of the Libyan experiment consisted (consists) in the fact that this experiment − a third way, transcending twentieth-century totalitarianism and moribund capitalism − showed (shows) up their own illusory ambitions, already condemned by history (see <a href="http://greencharter.com/" target="_blank">Green Charter Movement</a> <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theoryGreenBook.htm" target="_blank">Third Universal Theory (1)</a> and <a href="http://countrystudies.us/libya/78.htm" target="_blank">(2)</a>. There is more to Qaddafi’s death sentence than his flaws, shortcomings and errors (the worst being his reckless “openings” to the West – give a vampire a hand, or even a finger, and he’ll tear off your arm and then devour your heart and brain). There is more. That ‘more’ is to be found in his immense merits (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMXyCqdPPoU" target="_blank">video 1</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYxxSblD9eM&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">video 2</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJURNC0e6Ek" target="_blank">video 3</a>), his intelligence and sincerity, his courage (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZZvPlGCt_8" target="_blank">video 4</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvOo5LK22sg" target="_blank">video 5</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD5IOPeAbc0" target="_blank">video 6</a>). The North Atlantic handed him over to the <a href="http://libyasos.blogspot.com/p/opposition.html" target="_blank">monstrous torturers and racists who sully the name of Islam</a>. Neither they nor Hamburgerland’s witch [Hillary Clinton], will have reason to cheer. Qaddafi represents the green idea which shall live on and shall indicate the only way out for humanity. Like a star, he is eternal. The one who laughed as he pummelled his corpse is now a dead man walking. He shall walk for only a brief time still.

<strong>Q.</strong> The Western media and other media too. For example, Al Jazeera, which showed only the (often false) footage that the aggressors wanted to be shown. The brutality of the loyalist troops. Popular ‘support’ for the rebels. Silence over the tremendous consequences of the airstrikes on the civilian population. The blood on the rebels’ hands. A well-oiled propaganda mill, after the ‘mistakes’ of the Viet Nam war (once upon a time, reporters would flock to the front line). Now, all we see are the embedded TV and newspaper hacks and their endless drivel. What are your thoughts on the West’s so-called free press?

<strong>A:</strong> The press is now completely in the hands of the loan sharks and warmongers. Here we see political correctness in action. And it makes very little difference if you think you’re a ‘left-winger’ (note the etymology!) or a ‘right-winger’. Both camps belong to the same system of exploitation and manipulation of the masses. I saw a newspaper hack from the ANSA agency at my press conference on 27 October. He quietly disappeared after the first quarter of an hour. Of course, not one word from his ‘agency’ about my press conference. ANSA has in fact just entered into a fraternal agreement with Al-Jewzeera (something Mr Napolitano commented on approvingly).

<strong>Q:</strong> What about Italy? What’s the outcome for Italy, and its squalid, two-faced political class? Our FM, Frattini, took his orders from the Anglo-Saxons and from the powers that be, north of the Alps. And the government and the fake opposition grovel and obey every order issued by NATO, with Giorgio Napolitano’s support. The man who applauded the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 is now an unconditional supporter of NATO in Libya.

<strong>A:</strong> Ours is a longstanding ‘commitment’ to bombing (including mustard gas), invading and colonizing Libya (and massacring and deporting its inhabitants). It goes back to 1911. From the Giolitti government through to Mussolini’s, Italy incessantly plagued Libya until 1943, including horrific incidents such as Al Kufra. We betrayed Austria at the start of WWI. Toward the end of WWII, we betrayed Germany as well. All in all, we’re pretty good at betraying people! Berlusconi offered Jamahiriya Italy’s apologies along with war reparations, and he stipulated a Friendship Agreement. He’d done something that was not only right and just but also beneficial for our country. He then lost his one and only chance to go down in history with at least a feather in his cap. He will now be remembered only as the unreliable, cowardly, opportunist liar he really is. A real ItaGlian. As for Napolitano, I think I’ve already said enough.

<strong>Q:</strong> Lastly, Mr Fallisi, what can Libya expert now that it’s been ‘freed’ by NATO?

<strong>A:</strong> To find out what’s going on in Libya I urge everyone to stay away from the embedded mainstream media. Thankfully, snippets of truth can still be picked up here and there from the internet, at sites such as <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/libya/" target="_blank">Mathaba Libya News</a>, <a href="http://alfatah69.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">AlFatah69</a>, <a href="http://eccleza.net/" target="_blank">Eccleza</a>, <a href="http://libya360.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Libya360</a>, <a href="http://mcc43.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">MCC43</a>, <a href="http://libyasos.blogspot.com/p/news.html" target="_blank">LibyaSOS</a>, <a href="http://resistencialibia.info/" target="_blank">ResistenciaLibia</a>, <a href="http://www.algeria-isp.com/" target="_blank">AlgeriaISP</a>, <a href="http://libia-sos.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">LibiaSOS</a> and <a href="http://news.stcom.net/" target="_blank">STcom</a>. You will learn that resistance to the North Atlantic Terrorist Organization and to the Kali Yuga “rebels” has only just begun. The Libyan people are unwilling to lay their heads on the chopping block. I embrace them with all my heart and I hope they will win.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong>Pravda.Ru</strong>

With nuclear missile technology what it is today, the next war could very well be the world’s last. As it becomes clear that the Pentagon/NATO is intrinsically linked to the AIPAC/State Department axis, as it becomes clear that the USA and its allies have long since ceased to follow the law, it would appear that we are sliding towards disaster.

The tell-tale signs are all there. The former status quo which was achieved by a Soviet Bloc able and willing to counteract the more aggressive and belligerent tendencies of those who had been imperialist powers and their allies, gaining riches as they held populations down under the yoke of colonialism, stealing their riches and committing massacres as they civilised the planet with the Bible and the Bullet approach to international relations, disappeared at the beginning of the 1990s.

For once and for all, let us get the story straight. The Soviet Union did not “collapse”, it dissolved voluntarily, as catered for in its constitution because a new political, economic and social cycle had begun with different players and vectors and those in Government considered that the old model had succeeded in achieving what it set out to do, namely bring medieval societies into the front line of social, industrial and economic development, providing excellent public services free of charge.

However, a major consequence of this dissolution was the vacuum in international relations caused by the absence of the counterweight against the sinister plans of Washington and her NATO allies, which are only too plain to see. Before the decade was up, in 1998, we had Afghanistan’s Mullah Omar being approached with a bribe to set up a pipeline across his country from Central Asia to Pakistan and the game was then on.

The flashpoint was 9/11 and with the Bush regime in place, the game swung into action. Afghanistan was invaded in retaliation, although the link between Kabul and Kandahar and the Twin Towers has yet to be proven, and we now discover that Afghanistan itself is rich in mineral resources, apart from presenting a strategic bridge deep into Central Asia together with a billionaire drugs trade in heroin production and smuggling.

World War Three is not about containing hegemonic ideals, it is not about defeating ideology. This time around, it is based upon greed, the desire to control the world’s resources and it therefore comes as no surprise that all the pieces of the puzzle are centred around the epicentre of these resources – the Middle East and Central Asia, removing those powers who would constitute a bloc. It began after Kosovo, a test of forces, an arm-wrestling contest to see which side would blink first while under the table empty promises were traded, as they have been all along.

It continued with Iraq, invaded illegally and virtually destroyed in the most blatant disregard for international law the world had seen, before Libya confirmed what is going on. It has nothing to do with freedom and democracy, if so then why did NATO refuse to allow the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya to hold a democratic election for the people to choose between the NATO/NTC Terrorists and the Jamahiriya Government?

It has already begun in Iran, with cyber terrorist attacks against Iran’s nuclear power capacity, with violations of Iran’s airspace and with terrorist attacks inside the country aimed at Revolutionary Guard Officers, military centres and equipment. And for those who doubt who lies at the end of the railway line, the deployment of a part of the Missile Defence System in Turkey will cover a large swathe of the Russian Federation. Remember Washington’s hysteria during the Cuban Missile Crisis?

What the West (USA/NATO) is capable of, we have seen very clearly. What we have not seen yet is what exists to counter this Axis of Evil.

Washington’s position, smiling to the face yet wielding a knife behind the back, runs counter to the goodwill demonstrated by the Russian Federation when the Cold War ended and when political discourse centred on what the two former foes had in common, rather than differences. How is it possible to have anything in common with a back-stabbing, warmongering murderous group of criminals whose intention is to control the world’s resources and whose modus operandi is closer to skulduggery through Colour Revolutions than it is to the norms of diplomacy?

The recent intrusion into the internal affairs of the Russian Federation, funding activists to create problems after the recent Parliamentary election (DUMA) and the insolence and arrogance demonstrated by Washington’s Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, leave it perfectly clear as to the measure of the monster we are facing.

There are, nevertheless, two powerful vectors working against Washington, vectors it has not yet begun to understand. One is the military might of the CSTO and SCO Organizations, covering the Russian Federation, the PR China and Central Asia, essentially defensive organizations, the former of which Iran could join as the first non-(ex) Soviet member.

The other is the collective willpower of humankind which is very much more in tandem with Moscow these days than with Washington, more and more exposed and isolated as a hypocrite and a pariah of the international community, associated more with torture and sodomy than with freedom and democracy, synonymous with massacres and intrusion, arrogance, belligerence, blackmail and bullying rather than with diplomacy, discussion and dialogue.

Moscow stands for the rule of law, Washington stands for breaching it. Moscow stands for world peace and brotherly relations, Washington stands for hegemony at any cost. It is imperative that the members of the world community stand together, close ranks and appeal to those inside the United States of America who stand for collective human values to make sure their leadership, apparently as near to a sinister clique of Satanists and Devil worshippers as it gets, do not manage to bring Armageddon down to Earth.

In the forthcoming election in the USA, the people have a choice to vet out those who pose a direct threat to the future of humankind by bringing foreign policy and clear commitments towards this, into the political agenda. One thing is certain: Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are not fit to serve. They are a danger to their country, they are a danger to humankind.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By Peter Eyre</strong>

<em>The UN1973 Resolution was to create a now fly zone in Libya that established within weeks of the start of the NATO campaign. However, the second reason was to protect the Libyan civilians (or that is what we were led to believe).</em>

We heard Cameron and Hague state firmly the action that had taken place and the reasons behind that action which they said was primarily on humanitarian grounds!

What we in the UK did not understand was the fact that the final outcome was nothing to do with saving lives but rather to get their hands on Libya's vast lucrative natural resources. The entire campaign became a total blood bath that would leave over 50,000 dead and many many thousands of innocent Libyan civilians would become contaminated with radiation from the weapons used by the coalition forces. The active use of Weapons of Mass Destruction's (WMD) has basically killed the genetics of Libya, adjacent countries and the world beyond by it's over excessive use of depleted uranium weapons.

I have lost count as to how many cruise missiles they have fired off to date but I know that in the initial stages of the war it was over 300. At one stage, whilst watching this ungodly act of aggression, I counted 18 cruise missiles being fired in just one night. The target was a military compound that just so happened to be right next door to a densely populated district in Tripoli. It was obvious to me at the time that they would be contaminating many thousands of people during this particular onslaught. The radioactive fallout of nanoparticles would then drift, not only over this area, but also over the entire city and the region beyond. From my perspective, I found the use of many Cruise Missiles within this high-populated residential district of Tripoli the last straw!

My question to Obama, Cameron and Sarkozy would now be how many lives do you think you actually saved? I can assure you all that as a direct result of their actions in Libya, they have now committed an act of genocide and thus should all be charged with war crimes.

It is clear that with the British media being totally censored we will never fully understand the consequences of this deplorable war that the United Nations had approved and its subsequent use of Weapons of Mass Destruction on the innocent population of Libya with an emphasis on the City of Tripoli. This was not a war to enforce a “No Fly Zone”, it was a war to force a “Regime Change” which is in violation of UN1973 and in doing so also breaches at least five articles of the Geneva Convention.

To fire over 18 Cruise Missiles (WMD's) into the heart of Tripoli was certainly an act against humanity to which NATO and its command structure should be placed before the International Court of Justice. It was also a crime that was carried out right under the noses of the United Nations who stood by and did nothing to stop this genocide!

As we all know it didn't just stop at the use of Cruise Missiles but also Bunker Busters, JDAM and Hellfire Missiles (as used by the Predators unmanned aircraft and also by the Apache Helicopters) all of which were in violation of the Geneva Convention based on the following criteria.

Depleted uranium weapons are recognized as weapons developed illegally under the Manhattan Project in World War II by the United States Government. Already illegal and in violation of the 1925 Geneva Poison Gas Protocol, in 1943 depleted uranium weapons were described as a “highly mobile indiscriminate killer and permanent terrain contaminant,” recommended for development in the declassified Manhattan Project memo dated October 30, 1943.

It was only a matter of time when the scientists realised the military values of Depleted Uranium (DU) when they stated, “It has pyrophoric properties and may spontaneously ignite at room temperature in air, oxygen and water. These unique properties make it appealing for use in many civilian and military applications.”

The propaganda that has been handed out by the UNEP, WHO, ICRP, IAEA, Governments, DOD's and many other authorities (not forgetting the pharmaceutical industry) show that, in their opinion , DU is Low Level Radiation and is therefore harmless which actually falls well short of the truth that lies behind its usage. They have all failed to understand the health implications when DU/LLR is inhaled into the body. They have together concocted a trail of deceit and failed in their duty of care to protect the world's populations.

Because of this mismanagement, we now are looking at dramatic increases in many forms of cancer, diabetes, and infertility. Because DU/LLR directly attacks the genetics of our body via our DNA, we are witnessing terrible birth defects in babies.

The most complicated of all is the inhalation of nanoparticle aerosols of DU/LLR. Insoluble DU particle deposited in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli will be cleared much more slowly, and, therefore, would be expected to deliver a higher radiation dose to the lung from alpha radiation. Once DU/LLR has entered the blood an irreversible cycle commences. The tissues in our bodies filter out the depleted uranium particles from the blood and cause a web of diseases called “Gulf War Syndrome.”

It was obvious that when the coalition forces pounded Libya with their WMDs that the consequences for the people of Libya was going to be catastrophic. In the longer term, we are looking here at a progressive slow genocide that is beyond imagination.

Depleted Uranium has a half-life of 4.5 billion years and basically can never be cleaned up. It is fact that well over 500 missiles (each containing around 350 kg of DU) in some shape or form amounts to at least 175,000 kg. It takes about 50 tons (45,359 Kg) of DU contaminated dust to kill 500,000 people so one can see that when you add to this the DU that was also used by the US, UK and France in other forms of munitions such as Bunker Busters, JDAM bombs, other smaller missiles and the rounds fired from attack helicopters etc. we are looking at an incredible volume of DU being spread around Libya, other countries and the world beyond.

It is not just a simply case of saying that the coalition forces only breached one violation of the Geneva Convention i.e. The 1925 Geneva Poison Gas Protocol (radioactive poison gas)… they did in actual fact breach at least another four which has been covered in many of my previous articles.

What I find totally unacceptable is the fact that the United Nations is supposed to stand behind any breach of the Geneva Convention and does so with many offenders. However, these gross violations that have been committed by high profile members of the UN are not only totally disregarded but also dismissed.

One need only look at the military plans currently being laid down by the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom in wanting to take action against Iran (and Syria if they can get away with it) shows not only the continued use of Depleted Uranium but also with other very high tech weaponry that will have catastrophic consequences if used.

It should also again be put on record that the United States used totally illegal “Tactical Nuclear Weapons” during the Iraq War and also during the Afghanistan War…It is clear that we have many ongoing breaches of the Geneva Convention as well as War crimes by creating genocide on innocent people.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17976" title="cesaria-evora" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cesaria-evora.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="277" />
<em>Cesária Évora was, is and shall always be the voice of Africa for millions of people.</em>

<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

It would be no exaggeration at all to say that Cesária Évora was, is and shall always be the voice of Africa for millions of people. It is a fact that Cesária Évora is world heritage for the CPLP/Portuguese-speaking countries and shall always be. Because Cesária Évora is more than a voice, more than a heart and more than a soul.

At 70 years of age, Cesária Évora’s body left us in the Hospital Baptista de Sousa, São Vicente Island, Cape Verde this Saturday December 17. What will live on is far more than her voice, for her voice was simply a vehicle to convey her heart, her soul and the heart and soul of Africa. What will live on is the melancholy, the nostalgia, the unrequited love, the burning hope and desire, the love, the humanity… of Africa and Africans, in Cesária Évora’s voice.

And that, nobody can destroy or take away from this angel of world culture, born in Mindelo, Capital of the Isle of São Vicente, Cape Verde on August 27, 1941, who spent the first years of her life singing and enchanting and bewitching with her talent, and only in 1988, at 47 years of age, did she record her first album, in Paris.
Cesária Évora sprang onto the world stage in 1992, at 50 years of age, after presenting her fourth album, Miss Perfumado, in Paris and after the subsequent shows in the City of Paris Theatre. Six albums had Grammy references, a prize she won in 2004 (World Music, Voz d’Amor). Eleven albums are only part of her legacy, the last one being Nha Sentimento (2009).

Cesária Évora, or “Cizé” to her friends, had been born into a musical family – her father Justiniano da Cruz played the banjo, viola and violin, her brother played the saxophone and among the family friends, was the Cape Verdean composer, B. Leza. Her instrument however was her soul, through her voice, and from an early age she sang in the streets, in the market places “to forget sad things” in her words. Later, bars, hotels and a general acclamation as the Queen of Morna (Cape Verde’s national genre of melancholic song).

Her rendition of the song Sôdade (Nostalgia/homesickness) truly gives wings to any heart or soul from any generation from any age anywhere on Earth. Now that is world patrimony and Cesária Évora is its champion. Whoever listens to the voice of Cesária Évora hears a soul flying, hears the unlocking of thousands of years of Africa’s secrets, hears the spirit of Cape Verde, witnesses first-hand the heart of Africa.

How hurt the hearts of Africa, of Cape Verde, of the CPLP space are today; how noble, how honoured they shall be tomorrow with the legacy of Cesária Évora smiling upon them.

<em>The wealthiest families on planet earth call the shots in every major upheaval that they cause.</em>

<strong>By Prof. Dr. Mujahid Kamran</strong>

<em>Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organised, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.</em>
– Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States (1856-1924).

<em>So you see, my dear Coningsby, that the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes. </em>
– Benjamin Disraeli, British Prime Minister (1804-1881).

The advent of the industrial revolution, the invention of a banking system based on usury, and scientific and technological advancements during the past three centuries have had three major consequences. These have made the incredible concentration of wealth in a few hands possible, have led to the construction of increasingly deadly weapons culminating in weapons of mass destruction, and have made it possible to mould the minds of vast populations by application of scientific techniques through the media and control of the educational system.

The wealthiest families on Planet Earth call the shots in every major upheaval that they cause. Their sphere of activity extends over the entire globe, and even beyond, their ambition and greed for wealth and power knows no bounds, and for them, most of mankind is garbage – “human garbage.” It is also their target to depopulate the globe and maintain a much lower population compared to what we have now.

It was Baron Nathan Mayer de Rothschild (1840-1915) who once said: “I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the British Empire on which the sun never sets. The man that controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire, and I control the British money supply.” What was true of the British Empire is equally true of the US Empire, controlled remotely by the London based Elite through the Federal Reserve System. Judged by its consequences, the Federal Reserve System is the greatest con job in human history.

It is sad and painful that man’s most beautiful construction, and the source of most power and wealth on earth, viz. scientific knowledge – the most sublime, most powerful and most organised expression of man’s inherent gift of thought, wonder and awe – became a tool for subjugation of humanity, a very dangerous tool in the hands of a tiny group of men. These men “hire” the scientist and take away, as a matter of right, the power the scientist creates through his inventions. This power is then used for their own purposes, at immense human and material cost to mankind. The goal of this handful of men, the members of the wealthiest families on the planet, the Elite, is a New World Order, a One World Government, under their control.

Secrecy and anonymity is integral to the operations of the Elite as is absolute ruthlessness, deep deception and the most sordid spying and blackmail. The Elite pitches nations against each other, and aims at the destruction of religion and other traditional values, creates chaos, deliberately spreads poverty and misery, and then usurps power placing its stooges in place. These families “buy while the blood is still flowing in the streets” (Rothschild dictum). Wars, “revolutions” and assassinations are part of their tactics to destroy traditional civilisation and traditional religions (as in Soviet Russia), amass wealth and power, eliminate opponents, and proceed relentlessly towards their avowed goal, generation after generation. They operate through covert and overt societies and organisations.

Professor Carroll Quigley wrote:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The powers of financial capitalism had another far reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands to be able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole. This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert, by secret agreements, arrived at in private meetings and conferences.… The growth of financial capitalism made possible a centralisation of world economic control and use of this power for the direct benefit of financiers and the indirect injury to all other economic groups.</p>
Winston Churchill, who was eventually “bored by it all,” wrote around 1920:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, to those of Trotsky, Bela Kun, Rosa Luxembourg, and Emma Goldman, this world wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilisation and reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played a definitely recognisable role in the tragedy of French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the nineteenth century, and now at last, this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads, and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.</p>
<strong>The High Cabal Exposed by JFK</strong>

It was in the dark days of World War II that Churchill referred to the existence of a “High Cabal” that had brought about unprecedented bloodshed in human history. Churchill is also said to have remarked about the Elite: “They have transported Lenin in a sealed truck like a plague bacillus from Switzerland into Russia…” (quoted by John Coleman in <em>The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations</em>, Global Publications 2006). Who are ‘they’?

Consider the 1961 statement of US President John F. Kennedy (JFK) before media personnel:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society, and we are as a people, inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, secret oaths and secret proceedings. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy, that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence. It depends on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published, its mistakes are buried, not headlined, and its dissenters are silenced, not praised, no expenditure is questioned, no secret revealed… I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people.”</p>
Secret societies, secret oaths, secret proceedings, infiltration, subversion, intimidation – these are the words used by JFK!

On June 4, 1963, JFK ordered the printing of Treasury dollar bills instead of Federal Reserve notes (Executive Order 11110). He also ordered that once these had been printed, the Federal Reserve notes would be withdrawn, and the Treasury bills put into circulation. A few months later (November 22, 1963) he was killed in broad daylight in front of the whole world – his brains blown out. Upon assumption of power, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, immediately reversed the order to switch to Treasury bills showing very clearly why JFK was murdered. Another order of JFK, to militarily disengage from the Far East by withdrawing US “advisors” from Vietnam, was also immediately reversed after his death. After the Cuban crisis JFK wanted peaceful non-confrontational coexistence with the Soviet Union and that meant no wars in the world. He knew the next war would be nuclear and there would be no winners.

The defence industry and the banks that make money from war belong to the Elite. The Elite subscribes to a dialectical Hegelian philosophy, as pointed out by Antony Sutton, under which they bring about ‘controlled conflict’. The two world wars were ‘controlled conflicts’! Their arrogance, their ceaseless energy, their focus, their utter disregard for human life, their ability to plan decades in advance, to act on that planning, and their continual success are staggering and faith-shaking.

Statements by men like Disraeli, Wilson, Churchill, JFK and others should not leave any doubt in the mind of the reader about who controls the world. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wrote in November 1933 to Col. Edward House: “The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the larger centres has owned the government since the days of Andrew Jackson.” It may be recalled that Andrew Jackson, US President from 1829-1837, was so enraged by the tactics of bankers (Rothschilds) that he said: “You are a den of vipers. I intend to rout you out and by the Eternal God I will rout you out. If the people only understood the rank injustice of our money and banking system, there would be a revolution before morning.”

<strong>Interlocking Structure of Elite Control</strong>

In his book <em>Big Oil and Their Bankers in the Persian Gulf: Four Horsemen, Eight Families and Their Global Intelligence, Narcotics and Terror Network, </em>Dean Henderson states: “My queries to bank regulatory agencies regarding stock<em> </em>ownership in the top 25 US bank holding companies were given Freedom of Information Act status, before being denied on ‘national security’ grounds. This is ironic since many of the bank’s stockholders reside in Europe.” This is, on the face of it, quite astonishing but it goes to show the US government works not for the people but for the Elite. It also shows that secrecy is paramount in Elite affairs. No media outlet will raise this issue because the Elite owns the media. Secrecy is essential for Elite control – if the world finds out the truth about the wealth, thought, ideology and activities of the Elite there would be a worldwide revolt against it. Henderson further states:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Four Horsemen of Banking (Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo) own the Four Horsemen of Oil (Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP Amoco and Chevron Texaco); in tandem with other European and old money behemoths. But their monopoly over the global economy does not end at the edge of the oil patch. According to company 10K filings to the SEC, the Four Horsemen of Banking are among the top ten stockholders of virtually every Fortune 500 corporation.</p>
It is well known that in 2009, of the top 100 largest economic entities of the world, 44 were corporations. The wealth of these families, which are among the top 10% shareholders in each of these, is far in excess of national economies. In fact, total global GDP is around 70 trillion dollars. The Rothschild family wealth alone is estimated to be in the trillions of dollars. So is the case with the Rockefellers who were helped and provided money all along by the Rothschilds. The US has an annual GDP in the range of 14-15 trillion dollars. This pales into insignificance before the wealth of these trillionaires. With the US government and most European countries in debt to the Elite, there should be absolutely no doubt as to who owns the world and who controls it. To quote Eustace Mullins from his book <em>The World Order</em>:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The Rothschilds rule the US through their Foundations, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Federal Reserve System with no serious challenges to their power. Expensive ‘political campaigns’ are routinely conducted, with carefully screened candidates who are pledged to the program of the World Order. Should they deviate from the program, they would have an ‘accident’, be framed on a sex charge, or indicted in some financial irregularity.</p>
The Elite members operate in absolute unison against public benefit, against a better life for mankind in which the individual is free to develop his or her innate creativity, a life free of war and bloodshed. James Forrestal, the first Secretary of Defence of the US, became aware of Elite intrigue and had, according to Jim Marrs, accumulated 3,000 pages of notes to be used for writing a book. He died in mysterious circumstances and was almost certainly murdered. His notes were taken away and a sanitised version made public after one year! Just before he died, almost fifteen months before the outbreak of the Korean War, he had revealed that American soldiers would die in Korea! Marrs quotes Forrestal: “These men are not incompetent or stupid. Consistency has never been a mark of stupidity. If they were merely stupid, they would occasionally make a mistake in our favour.” The Bilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission and the mother of all these, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, are bodies where decisions about the future of mankind are arrived at. Who set these up and control them? The “international bankers” of course.

In his book <em>The Secret Team: The CIA and Its Allies in Control of the United States and the World</em>, Col. Fletcher Prouty, who was the briefing officer to the President of the US from 1955-1963, writes about “an inner sanctum of a new religious order.” By the phrase Secret Team he means a group of “security-cleared individuals in and out of government who receive secret intelligence data gathered by the CIA and the National Security Agency (NSA) and who react to those data.” He states: “The power of the Team derives from its vast intra-governmental undercover infrastructure and its direct relationship with great private industries, mutual funds and investment houses, universities, and the news media, including foreign and domestic publishing houses.” He further adds: “All true members of the Team remain in the power centre whether in office with the incumbent administration or out of office with the hard-core set. They simply rotate to and from official jobs and the business world or the pleasant haven of academe.”

<strong>Training the Young for Elite Membership</strong>

It is very remarkable as to how ‘they’ are able to exercise control and how ‘they’ always find people to carry out the job, and how is it ‘they’ always make the ‘right’ decision at the right time? This can only be possible if there exists a hidden program of inducting and training cadres mentally, ideologically, philosophically, psychologically and ability-wise, over prolonged periods of time and planting them in the centres of power of countries like the US, UK, etc. This training would begin at a young age in general. There must also be a method of continual appraisal, by small groups of very highly skilled men, of developing situations with ‘their’ men who are planted throughout the major power centres of the world so that immediate ‘remedial’ action, action that always favours Elite interests, can be taken. How does that happen?

It is in finding answers to these questions that the role of secret societies and their control of universities, particularly in the US, assumes deeper importance. The work done by men like Antony Sutton, John Coleman, Eustace Mullins and others is ground breaking. Mankind owes a debt to such scholars who suffer for truth but do not give in. Whenever you trace the money source of important initiatives designed to bring about major wars, lay down policies for the future, enhance control of the Elite over mankind, etc., you will invariably find them linked to the so called banking families and their stooges operating out of Foundations.

In April 2008 I was among approximately 200 Vice Chancellors, Rectors and Presidents of universities from Asia, Africa, Europe and the US at a two day Higher Education Summit for Global Development, held at the US State Department in Washington DC. The Summit was addressed by five US Secretaries, including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. <em>The real emphasis throughout the Summit was only on one thing – that universities in developing countries operate in partnership with foundations so that global problems could be solved! </em>These are <em>private</em> foundations and the only way to understand this emphasis is to realise the US government is owned by those who own these foundations. As an aside the inaugural address was delivered by the war criminal responsible for millions of deaths in Rwanda, trained in US military institutions, and awarded a doctorate – Dr. Paul Kagame! The very first presentation was made by the CEO of the Agha Khan Foundation!

In a fascinating study of the Yale secret society Skull and Bones, Antony Sutton uncovered numerous aspects of profound importance about this one society. In his book <em>America’s Secret Establishment – An Introduction to the Order of Skull &amp; Bones</em>, Sutton points out there is a set of “Old Line American Families and New Wealth” that dominates The Order (of Skull &amp; Bones) – the Whitney family, the Stimson family, the Bundy family, the Rockefeller family, the Harriman family, the Taft family, the Bush family, and so on. He also points out that there is a British connection:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The links between the Order and Britain go through Lazard Freres and the private merchant bankers. Notably the British establishment also founded a University – Oxford University, and especially All Souls College at Oxford. The British element is called ‘The Group’. The Group links to the Jewish equivalent through the Rothschilds in Britain (Lord Rothschild was an original member of Rhodes’ ‘inner circle’). The Order in the US links to the Guggenheim, Schiff and Warburg families… There is an Illuminati connection.</p>
Every year 15 young men, and very recently women, have been inducted into The Order from Yale students since 1832. Who selects them? A study of the career trajectories of many of those ‘chosen’ shows how they rise to prominence in American life and how their peers ensure these men penetrate the very fabric of important US institutions. They are always there in key positions during war and peace, manipulating and watching ceaselessly.

The influence of the Elite families on the thought processes of nations is carried out through academic institutions and organisations, as well as the media. Sutton writes:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Among academic associations the American Historical Association, the American Economic Association, the American Chemical Society, and the American Psychological Association were all started by members of The Order or persons close to The Order. These are key associations for the conditioning of society. The phenomenon of The Order as the FIRST on the scene is found especially among Foundations, although it appears that The Order keeps a continuing presence among Foundation Trustees… The FIRST Chairman of an influential but almost unknown organisation established in 1910 was also a member of The Order. In 1920 Theodore Marburg founded the American Society for the Judicial Settlement of Disputes, but Marburg was only President. The FIRST Chairman was member William Howard Taft. The Society was the forerunner of the League to Enforce Peace, which developed into the League of Nations concept and ultimately the United Nations.</p>
The United Nations is an instrument of the Elite designed to facilitate the setting up of One World Government under Elite control. The UN building stands on Rockefeller property.

<strong>Selecting Future Prime Ministers to Serve the New World Order</strong>

In his article, ‘Oxford University - The Illuminati Breeding Ground’, David Icke recounts an incident that demonstrates how these secret societies and groups, working for the Elite, select, train and plan to install their men in key positions. In 1940 a young man addressed a “study group” of the Labor Party in a room at University College Oxford. He stressed that he belonged to a secret group without a name which planned a “Marxist takeover” of Britain, Rhodesia and South Africa by infiltrating the British Parliament and Civil Services. Since the British do not like extremists they dismiss their critics as ‘right-wingers’ while themselves posing as ‘moderates’ (this seems like the anti-Semitism charge by ADL, etc. whenever Israel is criticised). The young man stated that he headed the political wing of that secret group and he expected to be made Prime Minister of Britain some day! The young man was Harold Wilson who became Prime Minister of Britain (1964-70, 1974-76)!

All young men studying at Ivy League universities, and at others, must bear in mind they are being continually scrutinised by some of their Professors with the intention of selecting from amongst them, those who will serve the Elite, and become part of a global network of interlocked covert and overt societies and organisations, working for the New World Order. Some of those already selected will be present among them, mingling with them and yet, in their heart, separated from them by a sense of belonging to a brotherhood with a mission that has been going on for a long time. These young men also know they will be rewarded by advancement in career and also that if they falter they could be killed!

Utter secrecy and absolute loyalty is essential to the continued success of this program. This is enforced through fear of murder or bankruptcy and through a cult which probably takes us back to the times of the pyramids and before. Philosophically ‘they’ believe in Hegelian dialectics through which they justify bringing about horrible wars – euphemistically called ‘controlled conflict’. Their political ideology is ‘collectivism’ whereby mankind has to be ‘managed’ by a group of men, ‘them’, organised for the purpose – a hidden ‘dominant minority’. ‘They’ believe that they know better than ordinary mortals. The Illuminati, the Freemasons, members of other known and unknown secret societies, all mesh together under the wealthiest cabal in human history to take a mesmerised, dormant and battered mankind from one abyss to the next. Former MI6 agent John Coleman refers to a “Committee of 300” that controls and guides this vast subterranean human machinery.

In his book <em>Memoirs</em>, published in 2002, David Rockefeller, Sr. stated that his family had been attacked by “ideological extremists” for “more than a century… Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterising my family and me as ‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.” That’s it!

<em>It could be the biggest, most explosive story in modern history. We are just starting to put the pieces together and understand what is going on in the occult financial geopolitical scene, and how a 117-nation alliance is working to free the Earth from financial tyranny.</em>

<strong>By David Wilcock</strong>

<strong>IT MAY BE THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO US</strong>

As I write these words, the average person is coming face-to-face with disturbing, if not dire news.

Not only could the disastrous financial debacle of 2008 be about to repeat itself, it may even be a lot worse this time.

As of November 28, 2011, media outlets announced that we could be as little as ten days away from a complete collapse of the Euro -- and with it, much of the rest of the world's economies could be pulled down as well.

Yet another grandiose "bailout" maneuver was used to buy some time -- but this has done little to address the gnawing unease in the public, particularly as the saber-rattling in the Middle East is again reaching a fever pitch.

This, at least, is the mainstream media's perspective on what is going on -- and thankfully, it is completely baseless.

In classic Orwellian terms -- such as "War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength" -- the mainstream media's "Global Financial Collapse" cry of doom may very well be the best thing that's ever happened to us.

At least in any known, recorded history.

<strong>A VERY MYSTERIOUS, VERY QUIET AND VERY LARGE-SCALE FINANCIAL SCANDAL</strong>

You are about to dive into a story that, for quite some time now, has been nothing but a great-sounding idea -- a wonderful "what if." Almost nothing of this story could be found in the mainstream media.

However, the bizarre origin of the story did briefly find its way into FOX's Glenn Beck show in 2009.

I highly recommend you watch this first, as it will draw you directly into the mystery -- which flickered for the briefest moment in mainstream media, only to disappear into shuddering silence:

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ttSmZknU9mI" frameborder="0" width="500" height="284"></iframe>

&lt;iframe width="500" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ttSmZknU9mI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Notice that Beck says FOX contacted the Treasury Department about this case, and received an official blow-off letter in response -- basically saying they had "no comment" on this 134 billion dollars in US bonds, seized at the Italian border, as it was "evidence in an ongoing investigation."

Beck then goes on to put up the numbers of which countries hold the largest numbers of US bonds. In order, they are China at 763.5 billion, Japan at 685.9 billion, the United Kingdom at 152.8 billion, Russia at 137.0 billion and Brazil at 126.0 billion.

Based on the public, unclassified numbers, 134.5 billion dollars in US bonds could only have been produced by Russia, the UK, Japan or China... no one else. The amount of money is so huge that if Russia produced it, they would only have 2.5 billion dollars in US bonds left over!

Joe Wiesenthal, the editor of BusinessInsider.com, said that whether this was a government dumping its bonds or a counterfeit operation, it was "gigantic" in scope and "unlike anything we've ever seen -- not just in size but also in sophistication."

According to Wiesenthal, in order to counterfeit these bonds, "it would be the kind of technology you would expect only a government to have." Wiesenthal also believes the 1934 issuance date on the bonds suggests they may be elaborate forgeries.

<strong>OTHER LINKS TO COVERAGE OF THE ORIGINAL SCANDAL</strong>

<strong>THE LAWSUIT IS NOW A REALITY FOR ALL TO SEE</strong>

Ever since this bizarre event happened, the only follow-up to the story has been in the form of an elaborate amount of 'insider' information leaked by Benjamin Fulford -- the former Asia-Pacific bureau chief for Forbes Magazine -- on a week-by-week basis.

Finally, the lawsuit at the epicenter of this investigation has now become a tangible reality -- validating everything Fulford has been saying about this mysterious case since it originally started.

Looming storm clouds threatened to demolish Fulford's credibility in a single crash of lightning as the all-important date of November 15th, 2011 came and went -- with nothing to show for it -- after years of fanfare and buildup on his websites.

However, on November 23, 2011, the clouds parted. A vast, 111-page legal complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. This complaint is now a provable matter of public record... as you are about to see.

I have since discovered hundreds of pages of intricate, complex material to read, firsthand eyewitnesses to interview, and official documents to scrutinize. There is no lack of "homework" to be done for those who are interested.

<strong>MAINSTREAM MEDIA PICKED UP THE STORY AS OF DECEMBER 5, 2011
</strong>
Dan McCue started asking the same questions you may now be thinking about... and as a result, he was the first mainstream journalist to cover this story in <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/aboutus.html">Courthouse News Service,</a> a nationwide news service for lawyers and the news media.

McCue isn't necessarily convinced -- the article is entitled <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/12/05/41930.htm">"Bizarre Claim for $1 Trillion"</a> -- but given that this is a real case, he is certainly interested enough to write about it.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17923" title="trillion_dollar_lawsuit05" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/trillion_dollar_lawsuit051.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="285" />

<strong>THE FIRST MAINSTREAM ARTICLE TO EXPLORE THIS STUNNING CASE
</strong>

<a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/12/05/41930.htm" target="_blank">Here</a>'s an overview of what McCue wrote.

MANHATTAN (CN) - An American expatriate in Bulgaria claims the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, the Office of International Treasury Control and the Italian government conspired with a host of others to steal more than $1.1 trillion in financial instruments intended to support humanitarian purposes.

The 111-page federal complaint involves a range of entities common to conspiracy theorists, including the Vatican Illuminati, the Masons, the "Trilateral Trillenium Tripartite Gold Commission," and the U.S. Federal Reserve.

Plaintiff Neil Keenan claims he was entrusted in 2009 with the financial instruments -- which included U.S. Federal Reserve notes worth $124.5 billion, two Japanese government bonds with a combined face value of $19 billion, and one U.S. "Kennedy" bond with a face value of $1 billion -- by an entity called the Dragon Family, which is a group of several wealthy and secretive Asian families.

"The Dragon family abstains from public view and knowledge, but, upon information and belief, acts for the good and better benefit of the world in constant coordination with higher levels of global financial organizations, in particular, the Federal Reserve System," Keenan claims.

"During the course of its existence over the last century, the Dragon family has accumulated great wealth by having provided the Federal Reserve Bank and the United States Government with asset assignments of gold and silver via certain accounts held in Switzerland, for which it has received consideration in the form of a variety of Notes, Bonds and Certificates such as those described ... that are an obligation of the Federal Reserve System."

Keenan says that with accrued interest the instruments are now worth more than $1 trillion. He says the family designated him as its principal in an effort to select certain registered and authorized Private Placement Investment Programs (PPPs) for the benefit of unspecified global humanitarian efforts.

In his remarkable complaint, Keenan claims that the U.S. government [received] enormous amounts of money -- delivered in gold and other precious metals -- from the Dragon Family many years ago, and that the money was placed into the Federal Reserve System for the benefit and underwriting support of the dollar, "which was to become and currently remains the global reserve currency"...

The complaint alleges a complicated history with many moving parts and scores of internationally known and unknown characters, the sum of which is that Keenan claims he was entrusted with billions of dollars in bonds by the Dragon Family...

[These instruments were then stolen as two Japanese agents attempted to cross the border from Italy into Switzerland with them, contained in the suitcase you see in the image at the top of this article.]

[Keenan] claims that as the conspiracy continued to unfold, various high level officials repeatedly offered him a bribe of $100 million to "release" the instruments without disclosing their theft to the Dragon family, and to allow the instruments to be converted to a so-called UN "Sovereign Program" wholly under the auspices, protection and umbrella of the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the defendants.

Other defendants include UN General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon, Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Giancarlo Bruno, who is identified as head of the banking industry for the World Economic Forum, Italy's ambassador to the UN Cesare Maria Ragaflini, Ray C. Dam, president of the Office of International Treasury Control, and David A. Sale, the deputy chief of the council for the cabinet of the OITC.

Keenan seeks the return of the stolen instruments, punitive damages and court costs on multiple claims of fraud, breach of contract and violation of international law.

He is represented by William H. Mulligan Jr., with Bleakley, Platt &amp; Schmidt of White Plains, N.Y.

Interested? I encourage you to <a href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/12/05/41930.htm">visit Courthouse News Service,</a> as McCue does a great job of summarizing the rest of the case. This is just an overview.

<strong>YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME...</strong>

Courthouse News Service didn't quite have the stomach to quote one of the most interesting paragraphs in the entire complaint... but I do. This is where the whole story really started taking shape for me:
<blockquote>Upon information and belief, <strong>these Bonds [held by the Dragon Family] have values ranging in the many Thousands of Trillions of United States Dollars, a relatively small portion of which is involved in the claims giving rise to this action. </strong>

Each of these currencies, such as the DFFI [Dragon Family Financial Instruments] involved in this action, was and remains duly <strong>registered within the Federal Reserve System</strong> -- and are directly verifiable by the Federal Reserve through its efficient verification system and screening process.</blockquote>
Thousands of trillions of dollars? You have GOT to be kidding me! As soon as I read that, I had to know more... because I had enough information to be convinced that this was not a spurious lawsuit. I immediately lined up an interview with Fulford to clear this up.

The bottom line is that the Dragon Family intended for these bonds to be stolen. They represented only a small percentage of the overall asset base... all of which is clandestinely registered within the Federal Reserve and the Bank of International Settlements!

Fulford gave an introduction to the story in this interview -- and I then found out much, much more as time went on.

This was an elaborate sting operation that has brought us to where we are today -- where a vast international alliance of 117 countries now has a legal way to end the financial tyranny of the Old World Order.

<strong>A STAGGERING AMOUNT OF INFORMATION</strong>

I have been working solidly on this case, every day, for over three weeks now -- which in my current life seems like an eternity, given all the other balls I'm juggling at the same time.

The amount of information to assimilate and correlate, and the complexity of fitting the pieces all together, is staggering.

I have now been in extensive contact with Neil Keenan, the principal plaintiff in this case, as well as Keith Scott, who is also mentioned in the complaint. Scott is an expert in this utterly secretive world of trading between central banks -- and is well aware of the vast wealth underwriting them, all held in the strictest secrecy.

Keenan has never worked for any government or clandestine agency. He is a businessman who ultimately became acquainted with the Dragon Family -- the former ruling party of China, prior to the arrival of Communism -- and gained their trust.

I have now personally surveyed over 300 different photographs and dozens of separate documents Keenan sent me, related to this case -- including the now-infamous Book of Maklumat. They are extremely complex -- and extremely compelling. This all appeared <em>after </em>I conducted the interview with Fulford you are about to hear... and read.

This whole story is true. Devastatingly true.

It is the single biggest real problem the Powers that Were have ever had. That also means it's extremely good news for everyone else.

<strong>LOTS OF VALIDATION</strong>

In one particularly remarkable case of personal validation, I emailed Keenan with a description from one of my highest-placed insiders about what the boxes that contained these bonds actually looked like. None of this information had ever been put online.

Less than 15 minutes later, Keenan sent me dozens of pictures that precisely matched the description I had just given him. I was absolutely stunned. There is no possible way he could have faked something like that within fifteen minutes.

It is not yet clear whether I will release any of these images. The last thing I would want to do is to damage this case in any way, and it may also violate international laws -- giving the loyal opposition an easy way to attack me.

However, we do have at least one image that is safe to share. Here, again, is the photo released by the Italian media after these bonds were first seized:

<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Hello. This is David Wilcock and I’m here with Benjamin Fulford. This is another Divine Cosmos audio blog.

I’m interviewing Benjamin Fulford today, which in my time here in Los Angeles, California would be November 28<sup>th</sup>, 2011, a Monday – for Ben it’s already a Tuesday.

The reason why we’re doing this interview is Ben has, for a very long time now, been talking about a counter-insurgency against what I lovingly call the Old World Order, which is a mélange of international characters.

[This counter-insurgency] started out as an Asian secret society.

<strong>BENJAMIN FULFORD’S BONAFIDES</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: For those of you who don’t already know, I’d like to establish some of [Fulford’s] bonafides so it doesn’t sound like he’s tooting his own horn here.

Ben was the Asia-Pacific bureau chief for Forbes magazine. He has a long history of professional, credentialed academic journalism.

As you can find out from many other interviews he’s done, some of which are on my site, he got involved into a world of intrigue when he started to trace where the money was going from the Japanese economy.

He realized the economic stimulus that could be generated for the world was not being used for anything that was positive – and it seemed like a lot of money was disappearing.

That investigative trail led to him getting death threats and getting drawn into an Asian secret society as a counterbalance against the Old World Order guys.

<strong>SELLING HIS SOUL</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: [The Old World Order] also tried to silence him and bribe him by offering him – I forget, Ben, was it an ambassadorship they wanted to offer you, or something like that?

<strong>BF</strong>: They offered me at one point the job of Finance Minister of Japan.

DW: Finance minister of Japan. Right.

<strong>BF</strong>: They also, believe it or not, offered me General Electric and General Motors.

<strong>DW</strong>: Really!

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah.

<strong>DW</strong>: Like you would be the CEO, or something?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah, and I guess the chief shareholder.

The problem, of course, is I had to go along with their plan to kill four billion people. It’s the classic “sell your soul to the devil” situation.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. They just need to lighten the load and get rid of some surplus. That’s how they like to talk about it.

<strong>BF</strong>: Well, they want to save the environment and get rid of the “useless eaters”.

<strong>DW</strong>: Exactly.

<strong>FULFORD DIDN’T EMERGE UNTIL HE HAD PROTECTION</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So look, man, I’ve been on the Internet since 1996. I’ve had my own public presence since 1998. I watched you ever since you came out.

I noticed right off the bat – I believe you emerged in 2007 – was that correct, something like that?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah, it must have been around that time. I had been researching a lot of stuff before then, but I didn’t feel it was safe to go out in public because I knew they would kill me.

It wasn’t until I got protection that I was able to come out and start saying this stuff.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>MORE THAN THIRTY BOOKS AND OVER A MILLION COPIES SOLD</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: And it is true that within Japan, you are a bestselling author. How many books do you have in print and how many units have you sold?

<strong>BF</strong>: I don’t know. More than 30 books, and I don’t know, maybe a million in all. I haven’t kept track.

<strong>DW</strong>: 30 titles is very substantial.

You are fully bilingual. Nobody can challenge that. There are plenty of videos they can watch of you talking fluently in Japanese.

<strong>WHY WOULD YOU BE CHOSEN FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: I have seen endless iterations of every type of hate comment that someone would lob at you.

The most frequent one is they just can’t wrap their head around the story. They think it’s too implausible that these Asian secret societies would contact you.

I see that you are bilingual, and you are a credible financial journalist who then became a best-selling author. You are quite renowned for these, as you’re saying, 30 books you have in Japan.

There’s no other gaijin – that’s the word they use for foreigner – there’s no other gaijin in Japan, no other white guy out there that I’m aware of who is doing what you’ve done.

So who else would they have chosen for something like this – to try to bridge over to the Western world?

<strong>FULFORD COULD GET AWAY WITH MORE EDGY JOURNALISM</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Sure, look. What you have to realize is that there are a couple of reasons why I fell into this particular niche.

One is that I wrote a lot of stuff that if I had been a Japanese journalist, I would have been killed for.

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh really?

<strong>BF</strong>: But because I was a foreigner working for Forbes, I was off-limits.

<strong>DW</strong>: This is stuff that would have rattled the chains of the government, or stuff that would have insulted the Emperor? What are we talking here?

<strong>THE SECRET COLONIAL GOVERNMENT RULING JAPAN</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: I’m talking in essence about the secret colonial government here.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. [DW: Later in the interview, Fulford said Japan had been secretly run by the Rothschilds – since the Meiji Restoration of 1868.]

<strong>BF</strong>: They’ve been using a network of North Koreans and gangsters and bribed Japanese. They’ve been using bribery and murder to make this country into a colony that is only an independent country on the surface.

<strong>DW</strong>: Now I want to get back to that, but briefly…

<strong>BF</strong>: [crosstalk] OK, but let me just tell you how I got involved, in a really short summary.

<strong>DW</strong>: OK.

<strong>WROTE BOOKS EXPOSING 9/11, BEGINNING IN 2006</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: I basically started writing books in Japanese…

<strong>DW</strong>: And this was what year, approximately?

<strong>BF</strong>: I guess the ones that caused troubles came out around 2006. I was basically saying the 9/11 stuff that was uncovered by many researchers in the West.

<strong>DW</strong>: So this was before you ever appeared on Rense or anything in the West?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah.

<strong>DW</strong>: OK.

<strong>EXPOSING ‘SARS’ AS A BIO-WEAPON TARGETING ASIANS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: And then I had a book out in Japanese that pointed out that SARS was a bio-weapon that was designed to kill non-Caucasian people.

<strong>DW</strong>: For those who don’t remember, SARS was the bird flu.

<strong>BF</strong>: I quoted from the documents written by the Neocons, like the Project for a New American Century.

The documents pointed out very clearly that there was a group of Western elitsts that were planning on starting World War III and reducing the world’s population.

<strong>HE RECOMMENDED THEY CUT OFF THE MONEY</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: [I also argued that] Asians could stop this by cutting off their money – because they required Japanese and Chinese money to finance this insane project.

An order came out in the Japanese underworld to have me killed.

<strong>DW</strong>: That’s understandable, if you start putting your finger in [places it doesn’t belong….]

<strong>PROTECTION WAS OFFERED – AND HE LEARNED ABOUT FREEMASONS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The South Korean secret police then told the Chinese – and the Chinese sent a secret society to offer me protection.

That’s how I became involved in a world I never even knew existed until that time.

If you talked to me before that about Freemasons, you would have gotten a nervous giggle and a shrug, and that’s about it.

<strong>DW</strong>: It’s a funny handshake, and they give money to charity, and so on. Right.

<strong>“THE CHINESE” HAD EAVESDROPPED ON BOHEMIAN GROVE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The other thing is the Chinese themselves had eavesdropped on one of the conferences at the Bohemian Grove.

They were fully aware of this plan to start World War III, and they were trying to stop it.

When they realized I was being put on a hit list for trying to warn them of something they already knew about, that’s how I got involved.

<strong>WHO DO YOU MEAN BY “THE CHINESE,” EXACTLY?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: OK, one thing. As I’m talking to you I’m also responding to the fact that when we’ve published articles in the past, we get two or three hundred written comments on them.

I’m able to read what everybody says and the feedback they have. I’m trying to speak not just for myself, but also for the collective.

One of the stumbling blocks I think we’ve had in other interviews that people don’t get clear on is when you say “the Chinese,” people naturally think of this repressive government.

It’s burning people’s houses down in Tibet. It is restricting YouTube. It is restricting freedom. It won’t let people march on Tianmen Square.

It is basically just this human-rights-crushing monster.

<strong>IT IS AN ASIAN SECRET SOCIETY</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: OK. I guess I made a mistake when I said Chinese.

<strong>DW</strong>: Okay.

<strong>BF</strong>: I should have said Asia. This transcends China. It involves Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan and Korea.

In fact, it goes right to the group of non-aligned nations – a 77-nation group that included places like Yugoslavia.

It was wrong of me to call it the Chinese. It is an Asian secret society, not a Chinese secret society.

<strong>WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND THIS SOCIETY?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: OK. What would be the relationship between this Asian secret society and the current Communist government of China?

<strong>BF</strong>: Believe it or not, the old royal families of Asia decided that communism would be the best way to modernize China.

Behind and above the communist government of China and the government of Taiwan, you’ll find an old group of families whose connections go way beyond temporary political structures.

<strong>THE DRAGON FAMILY</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Now correct me if I’m wrong, but China was named after emperor Qin, who was of the Dragon Family. That was the first dynasty of China, right?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah.

<strong>DW</strong>: So these people… he’s the one who built the Terra Cotta Soldiers, where he took every soldier and every horse in his army and built a stone sculpture out of them.

There’s all sorts of interesting facts about how this Dragon family showed up. They basically erased all the history from China before then, which is now being rebuilt by certain scholars.

These Asian secret societies appear to be dynastic. They’ve largely been behind the scenes. They’ve amassed large amounts of wealth.

That’s part of what we’re into now. That’s what we’re talking about. Right?

<strong>COMPETING SECRET SOCIETIES, EAST AND WEST</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: You’ve got to remember that there are several different competing groups.

You have essentially a similar thing in Asia as in the West. You have secret societies that are connected to ancient dynastic bloodlines.

In the West that would be the Rothschilds, the British royal families, the Freemasons and the P2 Lodge.

In Asia, it would be the Dragon Families, I would guess. This would be all the various dynastic families and clan groupings based on family ties.

But, in the West you had a different group. It is confusing, because there are several groups that call themselves Illuminati.

<strong>SOME GROUPS OPPOSED TO BLOODLINE RULE</strong>

There is a group that has contacted me and they’ve proven to me they are connected to various agencies as well as international drug-smuggling rings.

They claim they started the French, American and Russian revolutions, and that they are opposed to bloodline rule.

[<strong>DW</strong>: I have already stated to Ben that this sounds like a rival faction of the same people trying to reinvent themselves. He said he is not joining them or supporting them – merely listening to what they have to say.]

In the same way, the Asians have a secret society that is also based on meritocracy. They are also opposed to bloodline rule.

The Chinese triads, the Japanese yakuza groups and various other secret groups in Asia have strict rules against nepotism.

The son of a gang boss could never take over his father’s gang.

These are linked to martial arts societies and also chambers of commerce.

There’s no clear line between chambers of commerce and outlaw gangsters being chased by police. It’s a gray zone. Light gray and dark gray, you know?

Both in the West and in the East, you have meritocractic secret societies and bloodline secret societies. OK?

<strong>ARE THE ASIAN SECRET SOCIETIES PRACTICING EVIL?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Could you just briefly enunciate for us… A lot of people have PTSD around hearing things like Illuminati.

As soon as you say stuff like that, the paranoia kicks in, and the fear and the anxiety kicks in.

So when you say that these are dynastic bloodline families in Asia – that these are secret societies – are they sacrificing babies? Are they drinking people’s blood? Are they doing satanic rituals?

[<strong>DW</strong>: This was a question I already knew the answer to, and just wanted him to clarify. He has repeatedly stated the Asian secret societies are vigorously opposed to these occult practices, and want to help create a better world.]

What are we talking about here in terms of: who are these people, what do they think, what’s their philosophy, what do they want?

Do they want to take over the planet? Are they fighting against the Illuminati to control the planet?

What is their agenda?

<strong>THEY WANT A FAIRER SYSTEM, NOT DOMINATED BY THE WEST</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: They think that the control of the future of the planet should no longer be controlled by a small Western elite.

They would rather have it fall under the control of the people of the planet.

There is a group, of course, of chauvinistic people who say China should rule the world – in China.

But, the general consensus in Asia as a whole is it should be equal for all the people in the world – not just for a Chinese or a Khazarian-controlled family business that runs the planet.

What they say publicly, I think, is really what they expect for now – which is a multi-polar world, not one controlled by a single group.

<strong>HOW DID YOU GET ALL THIS INFORMATION – AND FROM WHO?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: OK. Another question, which I think might help to allay the skeptics. There’s a lot of them, and they’re very nasty.

Could there be the possibility of a single-point failure in what you’re telling us?

Is it possible that all of the stuff that you just told me about these Chinese secret societies is the result of you meeting one or two guys, and them telling you these elaborate stories?

You call the guy on the phone every other day and he gives you new information, and that’s it.

<strong>FULFORD MET MANY OF THE MOST POWERFUL PEOPLE IN ASIA</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Listen. I was a journalist. I’ve been a journalist here for more than 25 years. I’ve met most of the post-war prime ministers in Japan.

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow!

<strong>BF</strong>: I’ve met finance ministers, the heads of most of the large corporations in Asia. Remember, I was the Asia-Pacific bureau chief for the world’s largest business magazine.

<strong>DW</strong>: But what does that really mean? How do you get to meet the Prime Minister? Why would they talk to you?

<strong>BF</strong>: I would go to Taiwan, I would go to China, I would go to Russia, I would go to Vietnam, I would go to Australia and I would meet the heads of large corporations who would want to publicize their companies.

<strong>DW</strong>: [crosstalk] Were you trying to sell ads?

<strong>HIS SOURCES RUN INTO THE HUNDREDS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: [crosstalk] What I’m trying to say is that since quitting that job, I’ve literally… my sources run into the hundreds.

I know the bosses of the Triads, the Yakuza gangs. I know the heads of the Japanese military intelligence and the police forces here.

I know the heads of the martial arts societies. I’ve talked to the politburo members in China.

So no, it’s not me talking to one handler or two handlers feeding me disinformation.

However, it’s true that they’ve thrown all sorts of disinformation my way to try to ruin my credibility.

[<strong>DW</strong>: Fulford is saying that SOME of his many sources have done this, not all of them. He has had to weed out many contacts over time. He has said publicly that if he catches any source lying to him, he breaks off that contact immediately afterwards.]

<strong>TRYING TO CONVINCE THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: At the end of the day, what people need to realize is I don’t need to prove this to the public at large. Right now we’re trying to convince the heads of the Pentagon, the CIA, the NSA, the KGB and the Freemasons.

In other words, we’re trying to convince the people who control the military industrial complex, and the politicians, that this is a better plan than what is in place now.

I’m sorry, but a lot of people out there have been so brainwashed by television that all you have to do is change what is on the TV to change their minds.

<strong>DW</strong>: Sure.

<strong>BF</strong>: I have provided tape recordings and photographs and videos and various proofs to assorted police and investigative agencies.

So I don’t really need to prove myself at this point. Although, if there is a legitimate criticism, I am happy to answer it.

<strong>WHO IS THE GUY WITH THE RASPY VOICE AND WALKING STICK?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh, I understand that. One question that I would like to edify here.

When we see videos of you in Japan, on at least three videos I’m aware of, you’re appearing with a man who seems to have – he is carrying a walking stick and he seems to have kind of a raspy voice.

So who is this guy and what is his connection? Most people don’t speak Japanese and they have no idea what is going on.

<strong>BF</strong>: His name is Chodoin Daikaku. He controls the world’s martial arts societies. He is the head of the karate associations, the aikido associations.

There’s a couple like the judo and the Chinese martial arts where he’s not the head of them, but he knows the guys who run them.

So he’s a bigwig. He’s not just some flake.

<strong>DW</strong>: OK. When you say he controls the karate association…

<strong>BF</strong>: Well, he’s the head of the organizations.

<strong>APPROXIMATELY 50 MILLION PEOPLE STUDYING JAPANESE MARTIAL ARTS</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: OK. So how many schools and how many people are we talking about that he would be working with?

<strong>BF</strong>: I think there are like 50 million people worldwide studying Japanese martial arts. They have karate schools in Mexico, in Iran, wherever.

<strong>DW</strong>: Sure.

<strong>BF</strong>: We’re talking very big organizations here.

<strong>DW</strong>: Couldn’t anybody just open a karate school without accreditation? Or are you saying there is an accreditation, and he’s at the head of that accrediting agency?

BF: If they opened a karate school, they probably got a black belt. They did that by going to some teacher affiliated with this organization.

<strong>DW</strong>: I see. So there is some sort of centralized authority that you have to appeal to if you want to run a karate school.

<strong>BF</strong>: If you want to get a belt, you have to study at one of these accredited schools. Yeah.

<strong>YOU COULD GET RECOGNIZED IF YOU ARE COMPETITIVE</strong>

DW: I see. So nobody could just hang out a sign and say “Here’s a karate school and here’s your black belt,” and have you be taken seriously if you wanted to go to a Martial Arts tournament and actually compete?

<strong>BF</strong>: It’s a meritocracy. If you just put on a black belt and go to these tournaments and beat people’s ass, they [the martial arts societies] will recognize you!

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs]

<strong>BF</strong>: [Laughs]

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs] OK.

[<strong>DW</strong>: What Ben is saying here is that many of these martial arts schools and tournaments worldwide have a central group that organizes them and keeps track of everything. Daikaku is the head of the largest of these groups.]

<strong>ALSO CONNECTED TO INSIDER JAPANESE SELF-DEFENSE FORCES</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: But within Japan maybe in particular, let’s say, this guy that you were referring to, Chodoin Daikaku…

<strong>BF</strong>: Daikaku. Yeah.

<strong>DW</strong>: He is sort of like the kingpin of martial arts groups in Japan?

<strong>BF</strong>: A major kingpin, let’s put it that way. He is also connected to the Japanese self-defense forces.

<strong>MOST INSIDERS WANT TO STAY INSIDE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What you need to realize is that most of the guys I talk to don’t want their name or picture out there at all.

<strong>DW</strong>: Sure! Absolutely.

<strong>BF</strong>: They refuse to let me name them or put out their photograph. But, I have introduced them to MI6, CIA types – and at that level they do communicate.

<strong>WHAT IS A TYPICAL DAY LIKE FOR YOU?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: I know it’s hard to pin you down time-wise. Could you paint for the average listener what your day is like?

How many insiders… how many different people do you think you talk to in a given week right now?

<strong>BF</strong>: It really depends. What happens now is I talk to people who are connected to large organizations.

I have one guy I talk to who I know has strong Pentagon / CIA connections.

There’s another guy I talk to who is definitely Rothschild, MI6 connected, British Royal Family type.

I’ve confirmed independently, through multiple sources, that these people are real.

<strong>WHO ELSE DO YOU TALK TO?</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Then there’s another guy I talk to who would be connected to the Japanese right-wing groups as well as the Asian secret societies.

Then there’s this Chodoin guy I talk to.

Then less often, for example, I talk to senior people in the Japanese gangs – like the Yamaguchi-gumi or the Inagawa-kai or the Sumiyoshi.

There’s a guy I talk to who is a KGB / Serbian intelligence type, who I talk to quite regularly.

<strong>DW</strong>: [crosstalk] From Russia or from Serbia?

<strong>BF</strong>: Originally from Serbia. I shouldn’t say more than that.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. I don’t want to betray your sources at all.

<strong>BF</strong>: For example, I’ve gone out drinking with the wife of the Prime Minister Kan Naoto many times. She lives in my neighborhood.

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow.

<strong>BF</strong>: There’s a lot of people I know.

<strong>A VERY INTENSIVE PLAN TO DESTROY FULFORD</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: There has been, though, and I’ve mentioned this… there’s been a very, very intensive campaign to make me seem like a flake.

<strong>DW</strong>: Sure.

<strong>BF</strong>: They have a book, about as thick as a phone book – a file on me.

First of all, they tried to kill me.

Then when they realized there was protection behind me, and whoever ordered the kill would be killed themselves in retaliation, the next thing was they tried to drive me into bankruptcy – by blacklisting me.

When that didn’t work…

<strong>HIS CAREER AS A PRIME-TIME TV PERSONALITY WAS DESTROYED</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Hold on. What do you mean by blacklist?

<strong>BF</strong>: OK. I used to have regular TV shows in Japan.

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh, you did?

<strong>BF</strong>: Oh yeah! Big prime-time shows.

<strong>DW</strong>: Like on NHK, or what network? [DW: NHK is the biggest, most popular TV network in Japan.]

<strong>BF</strong>: NHK had a 20-minute special on me on prime time. I had various networks.

The point is I was also able to publish stories in places in major Western media. But I got put on a blacklist.

<strong>DW</strong>: Around what time was that? What year?

<strong>BF</strong>: I guess that happened around 2005 or 2006. It was 2006, after I left Forbes and I started writing stuff about 9/11. That would be about it.

<strong>DID YOU START WRITING ABOUT 9/11 BY PUBLISHING A BOOK? </strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So 9/11 was your first major book that you put out?

<strong>BF</strong>: No, it was magazine articles.

And then I was holding press conferences at a foreign correspondents’ club, explaining why I was writing about 9/11.

<strong>THE WESTERN MEDIA WOULDN’T DARE TOUCH “9/11 TRUTH”</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: I was trying to get publicity in the Western media.

That’s when I realized that either they were scared of losing their jobs, or they were working for some agency and only pretending to be a journalist – and that the media was controlled.

I already knew it was controlled, but I didn’t know how thoroughly it was controlled until I had press conferences about 9/11 – and presented the evidence.

I had the New York Times correspondent telling me that he would be fired if he wrote about this!

<strong>NOT JUST “ARABS WITH BOX CUTTERS”</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So your opinion about 9/11 is obviously not “Arabs with Box Cutters.”

Could you synopsize what was your conclusion that got you in so much trouble? You’re obviously not supporting the official dogma around 9/11.

<strong>BF</strong>: I think the short story is that slogan – it was an inside job.

The evidence is overwhelming that it wasn’t done by a small group of Saudi terrorists with box cutters.

<strong>THE ALTERNATIVE IS TOO MIND-BOGGLING FOR SOME TO HANDLE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The problem that most people encounter is that if it wasn’t, then the implications are so mind boggling.

It involves such a large number of people and so much planning, and so many insiders, that people go into a state of denial.

Such a conspiracy is too large to be possible. And their minds shut it off.

<strong>IT CREATED POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER ON A MASSIVE SCALE</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: My major in college was psychology. I went through a suicide hotline internship, so I have the equivalent of a Master’s just in education.

[<strong>DW</strong>: I also worked for eight years as a counselor, and processed a total of 500 paid clients with about a 99-percent satisfaction rating.]

We learned, especially in crisis counseling, about PTSD – post-traumatic stress disorder.

It turns out that when someone has been traumatized heavily, they create a dissociative partition in their mind. It’s like a separate personality that handles the trauma.

They get very defensive.

Typically if you tell them information that brings up that PTSD, that triggers that trauma, they will attack the messenger.

The trauma is so severe that they will do anything not to actually re-experience it.

<strong>PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE PTSD AROUND THE HISTORICAL EXAMPLES</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: They have always had to create fake incidents in order to get people fired up to get into war.

You go back to historical cases, and people don’t have that trauma associated with it.

For example, if you look at why the Spanish-American war started, you’ll realize it was a fake incident.

Blowing up the ship the [USS] Maine, and blaming it on Spain. That’s a nice rhyming headline there, eh?

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs] Yeah.

<strong>BF</strong>: And then 70 years later, they say “we actually blew it up ourselves!”

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>BF</strong>: But if you were, at the time, saying it was done by the Americans, they would have lynched you in the street!

<strong>THE TITANIC KILLED 600 TOP OPPONENTS TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: You mentioned a mind-blowing piece of information about the Titanic.

<strong>BF</strong>: Remember a book came out a year before about a ship called the Titan that sank on its maiden voyage?

<strong>DW</strong>: That’s right!

[<strong>DW</strong>: Previously, Ben has said this book was deliberately released to “hide it out in the open.” This is a key aspect of the occult science these groups are working with. It helps them feel that we have chosen to be enslaved by them.

Technically, the book came out 14 years before the Titanic sank. You can read more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futility,_or_the_Wreck_of_the_Titan" target="_blank">here</a>.]

<strong>BF</strong>: They got rid of, in one fell swoop, about 600 industrialists who were opposed to the taking over of the Fed.

JP Morgan was saying “Hey, let’s all talk about it as we cross the Atlantic.”

Of course, he missed the ship at the last moment.

They were prevented at gunpoint from boarding the lifeboats.

<strong>WOODROW WILSON’S FAMOUS QUOTE: INSPIRED BY THE TITANIC?</strong>

[<strong>DW</strong>: Fulford has also said they deliberately did not put enough lifeboats on the Titanic. The captain knowingly sabotaged the ship.

The “women and children first” principle further insured none of the Fed’s opponents would survive.

This is not merely Fulford’s assertion – other researchers have suggested the same thing.

The Titanic tragedy of April 15, 1912 apparently inspired a terrified Woodrow Wilson to print his infamous quote in a book he released the following year. (See below.)]

<strong>WAS THE FEDERAL RESERVE PART OF AN APOCALYPTIC PLAN?</strong>

[<strong>DW</strong>: The Federal Reserve began operating on December 23, 1913 – with the passing of the Federal Reserve Act.

This is almost 99 years to the day before the Mayan Calendar end-date of December 21, 2012, which may have been intentional.

The Aldritch Plan may have been intended to create the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_reserve" target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a> in 1912, but it received a fatal blow when Democrats swept the White House and Congress that November.

Had this stunning political defeat not occurred, the Aldritch Bill may have ultimately created the Federal Reserve on the all-important date of December 21, 1912 – exactly 100 years before “the End of the World” in occult circles.

Given the cabal’s fascination with attempting to fabricate an Armageddon, as Fulford is about to discuss – as well as their love of ritual dates – such an idea is not difficult to comprehend.]

<strong>WOODROW WILSON’S QUOTE</strong>

[<strong>DW</strong>: In Woodrow Wilson’s 1913 book The New Freedom, Section 1, “The Old Order Changeth,” page 13, he said the following:

<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson</a>

“Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something.

“They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.”

This is only one of a series of revealing quotes at the above link that show how concerned Wilson was about the Federal Reserve.

This quote may have been triggered by Wilson having insiders tell him the Titanic disaster was used to murder 600 opponents to the Federal Reserve. In the picture below, from when the Federal Reserve debuted, Wilson looks deeply worried at best, if not terrified.]

<strong>BF</strong>: There’s a lot of stuff that’s gong to come out.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17924" title="trillion_dollar_lawsuit06" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/trillion_dollar_lawsuit06.jpg" alt="" width="436" height="627" />

<strong>SABBATAI ZANTH – PROPHET OF DO-IT-YOURSELF ARMAGEDDON</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The conclusion I’ve reached, and it’s really quite mind-boggling, is [this].

The story goes back to Sabbatai Zanth, a self-described Messiah of the Jews who lived in Turkey about three hundred and some years ago

He said he was a Messiah. It was the job of the Jews themselves to carry out the prophecies of the Torah. We shouldn’t wait for God to do it.

The sultan of Turkey had him called up and said “If you are really the Messiah, then do some miracles. If not, then convert to Islam – or else we will execute you.”

He couldn’t perform the miracles. So he pretended to convert to Islam.

Instead they worked on subverting the Turkish government from within. That was the “Young Turks”, eventually.

<strong>HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Did that become the Ottoman Empire, or is that something different?

<strong>BF</strong>: That was what undid the Ottoman Empire. Ataturk was one of their members – the founder of modern Turkey.

There’s hundreds of pages of documents to back up what I’m saying. I’m not just talking out of the side of my mouth here.

<strong>THE ROTHSCHILDS LIKED THE IDEA OF CREATING ARMAGEDDON</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The point is that the Rothschilds liked this idea.

You had this group – about a million-member sect – that believes the prophecies are inevitable. They can’t be stopped. And they’re actively working to carry them out!

This is the really mind-boggling part of it. It’s just too big and too ridiculous for most people to comprehend. But the evidence is overwhelming.

These prophecies call for a huge battle between two great nations – Gog and Magog. Armageddon.

90 percent of humanity would be killed in this battle. The remaining ten percent would be enslaved by the Jews, who would each have 2,800 slaves.

Now remember, I have Jewish ancestors on both sides. This is not mainstream Jewish thinking. This is a particular sect.

<strong>THE SABBATEANS</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Would that be Sabbatean Jews?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. Sabbateans I call them. I wouldn’t even call them Jews, because their belief system isn’t really Jewish.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS WAS INTENDED TO CREATE ARMAGEDDON</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: You had Israeli newspapers… they tried to set up this war between the Soviet Union and the West, which would have done that.

They almost succeeded in the Cuban Missile Crisis. I happened to be living in Cuba at the time – I was just a baby.

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow.

<strong>MANY OF THE WORLD’S NATIONS DID NOT AGREE WITH THIS PLAN</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What happened then – and this is where we get into hard financial history, international financial treaties, stuff that is very well documented in the archives.

A lot of the nations of the world said this is crazy. They wanted something different.

<strong>THE HISTORY BEHIND THE LEGAL ACTIONS NOW UNDERWAY</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: I’m going to take you back a bit so people can understand what is happening now and what specific legal actions we are taking against this group of fanatics.

<strong>DW</strong>: Please do. Yeah. I’ve read the entire 111-page document, thoroughly, as if it was a contract I would be signing myself.

When we get to that, I’d be happy to dialogue about it – but yeah, go ahead.

<strong>BF</strong>: I’ve been shown many, many, many documents related to this. Nothing to do with that lawsuit.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>JAPAN INVADED CHINA TO STEAL THEIR GOLD IN THE 1930s</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Essentially, in the 1930s the Japanese invaded China.

Their goal was to take the gold – confiscate the Chinese gold.

<strong>DW</strong>: Was Japan at that time trying to create what they called the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes, but Japan was also still linked to the British. It’s complex.

There were conflicting groups with conflicting goals. It’s not a monolithic story. There are different stories with different actors.

<strong>THE ROTHSCHILDS BUILT UP JAPAN… TO STEAL CHINA’S GOLD</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Japan was medieval up until 1877 when Captain Morgan, right, stormed the Japanese shore with gunboats and basically said “Westernize or die.”

[<strong>DW</strong>: My bad! I was hurriedly trying to remember something I wrote in a college paper in 1994. It was Commodore Matthew Perry, and the real year was 1868. Not Captain Morgan, getting them all drunk on his Spiced Rum! LOL]

<strong>DW</strong>: Japan then went into an extremely rapid, almost unprecedented industrial growth after that.

<strong>BF</strong>: It wasn’t a Captain Morgan [but you are right.] The Rothschilds built up Japan as a military colony to use to dominate China.

<strong>DW</strong>: Beginning in the 1800s?

<strong>BF</strong>: Going right back.

<strong>DW</strong>: So as soon as they Westernized. Right. Okay.

<strong>THE MEIJI RESTORATION: ILLUMINATI?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So the Meiji families – that was the Meiji Restoration where that all started. The Meijis were apparently kids, right? It was a youth rebellion.

Are you saying that the Rothschilds financed these youths and put them in power?

<strong>BF</strong>: They [the Rothschilds] took over the southern clans of Satsuma and Choshu, and then gave them modern weapons and used them to conquer Japan.

[<strong>DW</strong>: Interestingly, the word “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_restoration" target="_blank">Meiji</a>” means “Enlightened Rule”.  “Meiji” could therefore be seen as a Japanese derivation of the word “Illuminati.”]

<strong>DW</strong>: [crosstalk] So Japan was feudal until then.

<strong>BF</strong>: [crosstalk] Anyway, that’s an interesting thing, but let’s get to what’s happening today.

<strong>DW</strong>: OK, great.

<strong>JAPANESE MILITARY WAS SECRETLY PLAYING BOTH SIDES AGAINST CHINA</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: We need to go back to the 1930s. The point was that Japan was invading China. They had these bandits run by a guy called Kodama Yoshiyo.

They go into a town. They would seize the gold and loot the treasure.

Then the Japanese army would show up and say, “We hear you’ve got bandit problems. We will protect you!”

By that time the gold was all being shipped off to Tokyo, and then later to the Philippines.

<strong>DW</strong>: Very clever.

<strong>THE KUOMINTANG GOVERNMENT GAVE GOLD TO THE US IN 1938… FOR “SAFE KEEPING”</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The Kuomintang government didn’t want their gold to be taken by the Japanese.

In 1938, seven US warships filled with Chinese gold and silver were sent back to the United States.

A lot of gold was sent out before, too, going back to the 1920s.

<strong>THE US GAVE THEM 60-YEAR GOLD BONDS</strong>

The Chinese were given 60-year bonds. Let’s just stick to the 1938 ones.

They were given 60-year bonds in exchange for the gold they handed over to the Federal Reserve Board.

<strong>DW</strong>: I just want to thread this. Are you saying that the Rothschilds, to some degree, were still behind these criminal actions of stealing the gold?

<strong>BF</strong>: The American families behind the US Federal Reserve Board were trying to grab gold. The Rothschilds were trying to grab gold.

It was a gold grab, with different people trying to grab gold for themselves and for their groups.

<strong>DW</strong>: So Japan in some sense was acting as a proxy for [the Federal Reserve families in America and Britain.]

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes.

<strong>DW</strong>: Okay. That’s an important point.

<strong>BF</strong>: A lot of gold was shipped to the United States. The Chinese were given lots of US government bonds, with astronomical denominations, in exchange for that gold.

<strong>THE KUOMINTANG WERE NOT CHINESE COMMUNISTS</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: You mentioned that Kuomintang was the government at that time.

<strong>BF</strong>: That would be the nationalist Chinese government that was in power at that time. Chiang Kai-Shek.

<strong>DW</strong>: Are these the Communists, or is that something else?

<strong>BF</strong>: No. They weren’t communists. They were the people who then fled to Taiwan after the Communists took over.

<strong>IS THIS HOW TAIWAN ENDED UP WITH SO MUCH ECONOMIC POWER?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Well, here’s Taiwan – this little tiny country which has so much economic power.

That’s why China seems to be always trying to invade them and get it back.

Are you saying that that’s when this all started?

<strong>TREASURE HIDDEN BEHIND THE NATIONAL TAIWAN MUSEUM</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The Taiwanese took a lot of the treasure with them when they fled China.

They have a museum in Taiwan which is very famous.

[<strong>DW</strong>: The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taiwan_Museum" target="_blank">National Taiwan Museum</a> was founded on October 24, 1908.]

There are some hills behind the museum.

Every year they change the display in the museum. They’ve been doing that for 50 years.

They haven’t even begun to make a dent in displaying all the treasures they have hidden in those hills.

<strong>DW</strong>: My goodness. You’re saying these are subterranean vaults inside the hills?

<strong>BF</strong>: This is the ancient imperial treasure of China.

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow!

<strong>BF</strong>: And that’s just one of the many treasure hordes that are out there.

[<strong>DW</strong>: As we will explore in Part Two, one of my top insiders personally toured this vast underground complex -- and claimed it was hand-dug by a massive number of laborers. It is apparently 50 miles by 40 miles in size and seven levels deep.

One half of the complex is filled with gold -- and the other half with all the imperial treasures of China.]

<strong>WHERE DID ALL THIS TREASURE COME FROM?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Was this from the Mongolians? Where did all this treasure come from in the first place?

Did they conquer people and get it that way, or what?

<strong>BF</strong>: OK. For example, if you look at the old archives and history books, you will see that the Romans were buying silk and ceramics and spices from the Chinese… and paying for it in gold.

DW: Oh my God.

<strong>BF</strong>: And so were the Spaniards. They took all the gold they stole from the Aztecs and the Incas – and they spent it on Asian stuff!

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh my God!

<strong>85 PERCENT OF THE WORLD’S GOLD ENDED UP IN ASIA</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: About 85 percent of the world’s gold ended up in Asia over the past [few] thousands of years.

<strong>DW</strong>: I’m really getting it now. This is amazing! Go ahead.

<strong>BF</strong>: Part of what World War II was about was a grab for this gold.

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow.

<strong>DO THEY HAVE MILITARY GUARD AROUND THE TAIWAN MUSEUM?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Do they have military fortification around these hills in Taiwan?

Obviously they would have to guard that very extensively, if you are saying there are that many assets there.

<strong>BF</strong>: Sure. Their big plan for when China invades is to scoot out the back side with all their gold! [Laughs]

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs]

<strong>BF</strong>: [Laughs] Getting back to the thread…

<strong>DW</strong>: So the Kuomintang fled China to Taiwan.

<strong>THE WESTERN OLIGARCHS WANTED TO CONTROL THE WORLD’S GOLD</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What happened was the Western powers – the Western oligarchs, let’s call them – planned to take all the gold out of private hands in the world.

<strong>DW</strong>: What timeframe are we in now? 1938?

<strong>BF</strong>: This is in the 1930s. Remember, in 1934, Roosevelt banned the private ownership of gold.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. Allegedly due to the Great Depression and the need to [save the economy by pooling everyone’s gold assets into the Federal Reserve.]

<strong>BF</strong>: Right. The Jews didn’t want to give up their gold. That was one of the reasons why they were rounded up and sent to concentration camps.

The Asians didn’t want to give up their gold. That’s why they sent the Japanese army to come in and take it.

<strong>THE FEDERAL RESERVE TOOK GOLD OUT OF THE SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: With the Federal Reserve, the basic idea was that Roosevelt said, “Everybody [has to give up their gold.]”

Some people may still not know this if they’re that ignorant. The Federal Reserve confiscated everybody’s gold.

Even if you had it in a safe deposit box in a bank, they looted your safe deposit box and they took your gold away. Correct?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. They’re doing that now, too.

<strong>DW</strong>: Really!

<strong>BF</strong>: If you have gold in a safety deposit box and they haven’t taken it yet, get it out! ASAP!

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow.

<strong>BF</strong>: Anyway, let’s go back to the history.

<strong>MOST OF THE WORLD’S GOLD WAS TAKEN OFF-MARKET BY 1944</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: In 1944, they had the Bretton Woods agreement. At this agreement, the gold-backed international financial system was set up.

Most of the gold that was not being controlled by the Western powers was removed from the market.

<strong>DW</strong>: How do you mean “removed from the market?”

<strong>BF</strong>: It was blacklisted, or hidden in caves, or buried in sunken ships at the bottom of the ocean.

DW: Wow. So you’re saying that this equity did not count towards whatever currencies were created worldwide.

<strong>BF</strong>: No. It was taken off-market. This is a question of control.

<strong>THE THAI ROYAL FAMILY’S GOLD AND THE PERSIAN GOLD WAS BLACKLISTED</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: So, for example, the Thai royal family had lots and lots of gold. They are not allowed to cash that – even to this day.

The same with the Persian gold, which was shipped to Thailand when the Shah of Iran fell.

But again, let’s try to get to the thread. Let’s stick to the plot here. We’ll go back to this stuff later.

<strong>DW</strong>: Understood.

<strong>BRETTON WOODS WAS A 50-YEAR MANDATE FOR GLOBAL CONTROL</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: So in 1944, Britain, France and the United States were given a fifty-year control over the global financial system. A fifty-year mandate.

They were supposed to develop and modernize the planet.

However, Roosevelt was poisoned – killed. He didn’t just die.

There was a fascist coup.

The military-industrial complex guys, instead of developing the planet, they wanted this cold war between the Soviet Union and the West.

This was part of this Gog / Magog plan.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>BY 1955, 77 NATIONS OPPOSED THE BRETTON WOODS PLAN</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: In 1955, the non-aligned nations – that’s a 77-nation group, including China, Indonesia, Yugoslavia, India – said this is crazy. We don’t want to be part of this Cold War.

They had the historical rights to most of the Asian treasure.

<strong>DW</strong>: Were most of the Asian countries represented in the non-aligned nations?

<strong>BF</strong>: Oh yeah! Pretty well all of them.

<strong>DW</strong>: How about South America?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. A lot of the countries are there. Brazil was a part of the non-aligned nations.

<strong>DW</strong>: How about Africa?

<strong>BF</strong>: Africa was still a proxy colony.

<strong>DW</strong>: Okay.

<strong>THE NON-ALIGNED NATIONS WANTED TO MODERNIZE ASIA AND AFRICA</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The point is that 77 nations – I don’t have the list in front of me now, but it included most of the people on the planet.

Just not the Soviet Union and North America – the European peoples, basically.

They [the non-aligned nations] said they wanted to finance a Marshall Plan for Asia and Africa – to modernize these regions.

<strong>DW</strong>: This is the non-aligned nations that wanted this.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes. They pooled their treasure to finance this.

<strong>THEY CREATED THE “HILTON GREEN MEMORIAL” TREATY IN 1963</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: There’s an international treaty that people who dug me can look up. It’s called the Hilton Green Memorial.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. I’ve seen you talk about that.

<strong>THE ONLY ONLINE VERSION OF THIS DOCUMENT IS AN OBVIOUS FRAUD</strong>

[<strong>DW</strong>: Fulford's own insiders have now shown me some of the real documents. A painfully fraudulent version of it was created and “leaked” online. One Indonesian blogger wrote about this agreement <a href="http://lisnosetiawan.blogspot.com/2008/11/green-hilton-agreement-geneva-1963.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

The <a href="http://ramasakti101.multiply.com/photos/album/14/Green_Hilton_Memorial" target="_blank">online version</a> is an obvious fraud, as it is supposedly from 1963, but it clearly uses modern Microsoft Word-style Times New Roman fonts, complete with bold.

Even the way the ink was stained is consistent with what happens when you wet down a printout from a modern inkjet printer.

Furthermore, I have seen typewritten documents from the 1950s that don’t look anywhere near this distressed.

The obvious problems with the online documents are discussed here – including the fact that the alleged US Presidential seal is actually based on something Indonesian (see <a href="http://www.educationforum.ipbhost.com/index.php?showtopic=9198" target="_blank">here</a>).

It is inevitable that fraudulent documents will be created in a case like this in such a sensitive issue. They lure in the unwary “believers” while convincing the skeptics that it’s nonsense.]

<strong>PRESIDENT SUKARNO HAD A STRONG BLOODLINE CONNECTION</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: [The Hilton Green Memorial] was the treaty where they wanted to finance a Marshall Plan for developing Asia and Africa and the rest of the world.

<strong>DW</strong>: And they had as their asset base these black-listed gold funds that were in Thailand?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes. And the signatory to all this money was President Sukarno of Indonesia, who happened to be related to most of the royal families – at least in Asia.

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh! So that’s why Indonesia, then. It’s because he had a blood connection to these folks.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes. They designated him as a signatory.

<strong>BENJAMIN FREEDMAN BLEW THE WHISTLE ON ARMAGEDDON PLANS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: When the Cuban Missile Crisis came, and the world nearly went to all-out nuclear war, a guy named Benjamin Freedman came out.

He basically admitted these insane Gog-Magog plans [were real].

[<strong>DW</strong>: The key Benjamin Freedman speech was at the Willard Hotel in Washington DC, 1961. The Cuban Missile Crisis did not actually happen until 1962, but the tensions were already very high by 1961.

You can download MP3s of the audio of this speech <a href="http://www.erichufschmid.net/TFC/Ben_Freedman.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

The full transcript is available <a href="http://www.sweetliberty.org/issues/israel/freedman.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.]

<strong>KENNEDY GOT THE MESSAGE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Kennedy and a lot of people in the US said “All right, this is crazy. We don’t any more of this secret society craziness.”

He agreed to work with the non-aligned nations to end the Cold War, and to finance the development of Africa and Asia.

To keep the military industrial people happy, he was going to send a man to the moon – and do that kind of stuff.

<strong>DW</strong>: Did Benjamin Freedman also blow the whistle on what was going on behind the Cuban Missile Crisis? Is that why you mentioned that?

<strong>BF</strong>: He said they’re trying to create this war so they can take over the planet. There is plenty of evidence for this.

<strong>KENNEDY GOT INDONESIAN GOLD AND ISSUED U.S. TREASURY NOTES</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Kennedy got gold from Indonesia.

He put out Kennedy bonds and notes – dollar bills that were controlled by the US Department of Treasury, not the Federal Reserve Board.

<strong>DW</strong>: That was Executive Order 11110, right?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah, something like that.

<strong>IT’S A LITTLE MORE COMPLEX THAN WE THOUGHT</strong>

[<strong>DW</strong>: The story of Executive Order 11110 is a little more complex than I thought – once I actually did more research.

Kennedy signed this bill just days before he died. It stopped the US Treasury from selling its silver to private buyers, and gave the President the right to issue silver-backed currency – without the permission of the Federal Reserve System.

The Federal Reserve may well have been deliberately buying up all the Treasury silver so they could ultimately print as much money as they wanted – without having to back it up with any solid assets.

The Wikipedia page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_11110" target="_blank">Executive Order 11110</a> has a deviously interesting spin on the story, where it tries to argue that this plan actually expanded the powers of the Federal Reserve – since silver coins were replaced with dollar bills.

However, by stopping the bleeding of this precious metal out of the Treasury, Kennedy’s act actually protected silver. 11110 also gave the President the direct ability to issue certificates – dollars – that were backed by silver as collateral.

The US Treasury Secretary was stripped of the power to issue silver notes. Kennedy probably did this because the Treasury Secretary was being controlled by the Federal Reserve.

Kennedy probably felt that silver-backed dollars would be a stopgap against inflation and the creation of “bubble money” by the Federal Reserve.

His assassination, just days later, did not appear to be a coincidence.

If Fulford’s sources are right, Executive Order 11110 was only the first visible phase of Kennedy’s plan to defeat the Federal Reserve and ultimately use Asian gold as collateral for a new financial system.]

<strong>THE CABAL KILLED KENNEDY AND DROVE SUKARNO FROM POWER</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: [Kennedy] was killed.

Then Sukarno was driven from power.

<strong>DW</strong>: By whom, are you saying? Who drove Sukarno from power?

<strong>BF</strong>: By the West. By the military-industrial complex. By the Cabal, as I call them.

The people who own the Federal Reserve Board. These Sabbatean sectists.

<strong>THE ASIAN SOCIETIES DIDN’T HAVE THE MILITARY POWER TO FIGHT BACK</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Couldn’t the Asian societies designate a new signatory that would bring these blacklisted funds online and create a new currency that would compete with the dollar?

<strong>BF</strong>: Well, they didn’t have the military power.

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh.

<strong>BF</strong>: What they did is they went underground. They didn’t sign over anything.

<strong>SUKARNO’S NEPHEW SIGNED OVER THE RIGHTS… TO MAKE THIS CURRENT LAWSUIT A REALITY</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: We have Sukarno’s nephew. [He] has signed over the rights to us now.

We’ll get back to that.

<strong>THE CABAL FORGED THE RIGHTS TO ISSUE CURRENCY AGAINST THE ASIAN GOLD IN 1968</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What happened was that in 1968, they set up a fake heir. A fake signatory.

<strong>DW</strong>: “They” is the Asian societies?

<strong>BF</strong>: No no. This would be Henry Kissinger, the Rockefellers and all these people. The Bushes. The people behind the murder of Kennedy. The members of this Sabbatean cabal.

<strong>DW</strong>: They set up a fake heir [who would allegedly gain the rights] to what?

<strong>BF</strong>: They forged the rights to use that money as a basis for issuing currency. For creating dollars.

They didn’t have the historical rights to 85 percent of the world’s gold that was owned by the Asians – but they faked the rights.

They forged documents to claim they had the rights.

<strong>STOLEN ASIAN GOLD WAS LAUNDERED TO FINANCE “BLACK OPS”</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So they wanted to repatriate this gold they had taken out of the market before Bretton Woods was convened.

<strong>BF</strong>: Some of it was laundered by BCCI, Chase Manhattan Bank, Black Eagle Trust and a few other of these groups.

It was this gold that was illegally laundered from these Asian stashes that financed the black ops and the various secret doings.

<strong>THE LAUNDERED GOLD WAS ORIGINALLY STOLEN IN THE 1930s</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So this gets back to what you were saying in the 1930s, where the Japanese troops were confiscating gold from the Kuomintang.

<strong>BF</strong>: Right. That was taken either to the Philippines or to Japan. At first to Japan, and then when it got too iffy, they transported it over to the Philippines.

<strong>THE GOLD WAS HIDDEN IN ABOUT 125 KNOWN SITES</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Now that wasn’t kept in any type of Federal Reserve Bank for those countries. That was kept in some kind of private storage that was totally offline.

<strong>BF</strong>: It was hidden. There are about 125 known sites where it was hidden.

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow.

[<strong>DW</strong>: David Guyatt, a 28-year veteran investment banker within the Cabal-controlled City of London, gave incredible supporting evidence, including documents, for everything Fulford is saying <a href="http://www.deepblacklies.co.uk/about.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.

In many ways, Guyatt goes into vastly more detail about the story behind this hidden gold than Fulford has done here.

In his online book “The Secret Gold Treaty,” Guyatt’s data suggests there were 172 sites where the <a href="http://www.deepblacklies.co.uk/secret_gold_treaty.htm" target="_blank">plundered gold was stolen</a>.]

Fulford's own insiders have since told me there are even more than 172 sites involved.]

<strong>AT LEAST TEN OLYMPIC-SIZED POOLS’ WORTH OF “OFF-MARKET” ASIAN GOLD</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: How much tonnage are we talking about here? How much gold was it?

<strong>BF</strong>: What I’ve been told is [this].

The story we’ve all been told about how all the gold ever mined in history could fit into one or two Olympic swimming pools… is a total lie.

There’s at least nine times or ten times more off-market gold than there is officially tradable gold.

<strong>DW</strong>: My God!

<strong>BF</strong>: Some of it, like I say, was laundered by the CIA types to finance various things.

<strong>ASIANS IN THE GOLDEN TRIANGLE CONTACTED THE CIA</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Now again, I want to take a little side trip here. One of these Asian secret society groups I contacted worked in the Golden Triangle during the Vietnam War.

<strong>DW</strong>: Where is that?

<strong>BF</strong>: That’s the area between China and Vietnam where they were producing all the heroin in those years.

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh goodness.

<strong>BF</strong>: And they were selling heroin to the CIA. And the CIA was selling the heroin to finance their black ops.

<strong>DW</strong>: So they had quite a markup off of the original price that they were paying.

<strong>BF</strong>: It was a big business that was out of the control of governments.

What happened was the Asians contacted their old CIA contacts. They said, “What the hell are you guys doing? Why are you spreading diseases and trying to start World War III?”

<strong>THEY DIDN’T LIKE BEING USED</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: So a lot of these CIA bad guys came out and started helping us. It was kind of ironic, but it’s still welcome.

<strong>DW</strong>: Maybe they’re trying to avoid the hangman’s noose, right? [Laughs]

<strong>BF</strong>: They realized they were being fooled by this fake anti-communism. They didn’t like being fooled and used.

<strong>DW</strong>: I did speak to one guy who worked in the CIA and actually worked with one of the recent American presidents in cocaine smuggling.

He explained to me, in quite some detail, the rationale behind why they felt it was necessary to try to control the flow of cocaine.

They have all these rationalizations. “We don’t want people to die from bad cocaine.” “If we can control it, then we know exactly where it’s going.”

<strong>BF</strong>: “Plus we get these Swiss bank accounts, with all this money.” You know?

<strong>DW</strong>: Right! Exactly.

<strong>BF</strong>: …Which helps lubricate your conscience a little bit… but still.

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs]

<strong>BF</strong>: [Laughs]

<strong>THE 50-YEAR BRETTON WOODS MANDATE EXPIRED IN 1994</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Anyway, let’s get back to the main flow.

In 1994, the Bretton Woods mandate expired.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. You said this was a 60-year commission that started in 1944.

<strong>BF</strong>: A 50-year commission. Before that, they stole the money from the foreign holdings, the dollar holdings of the Soviet Union.

<strong>DW</strong>: I’m sorry, I want to ask you one dumb question, though. You’re saying 1944, but World War II didn’t end until 1945.

<strong>BF</strong>: The Bretton Woods conference was in 1944. They already knew what was going to be the result [from World War II]. That’s open history. Bretton Woods is an open secret.

<strong>DW</strong>: So you said that the mandate expired in 1944 after a 50-year term.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes. It wasn’t renewed.

<strong>IN 1994, ABOUT 200 COUNTRIES SAID THE PROMISES WERE NOT KEPT</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: They said, “Hey, France, United States and Britain. You didn’t modernize the world. You didn’t keep your promises.”

<strong>DW</strong>: Who is “they” in this case?

<strong>BF</strong>: It would be all the other countries. Remember, you have [about] 200 countries that have sovereign rights still.

<strong>DW</strong>: So they would have to ratify the agreement to get it to renew. They would have to sign off on it.

<strong>BF</strong>: Right. So there has been no real agreement at the top of the global financial system since then.

<strong>DW</strong>: So the only reason why it hasn’t changed any faster is they don’t have the military muscle to do anything about this.

<strong>BF</strong>: That’s part of it.

<strong>CLINTON AUTHORIZED 100-TO-1 FINANCIAL GAMBLING PRACTICES</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: President Clinton, he started… these guys were thinking, “The hell with it. We’re just going to start World War III and get ourselves out of this mess by killing everybody.”

Clinton started off by allowing 100 times leverage. Gambling 100 times. So with one dollar, you could buy 100 dollars’ worth of tickets.

If it goes from 100 dollars to 200 dollars, then your one dollar is multiplied by a hundredfold.

They turned the financial system into extreme gambling.

[<strong>DW</strong>: They obviously knew this could have apocalyptic effects, under certain circumstances, but that was the whole point… as Fulford said.]

<strong>DW</strong>: Were they using these confiscated gold accounts from the Kuomintang to back that up?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. They didn’t have any legal backing anymore, but they were going ahead with it anyway.

<strong>THE KUOMINTANG SUED THE FED IN 1998 FOR THE RETURN OF THEIR GOLD</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Now what happened was in 1998, the Chinese sued the Federal Reserve Board. They said “Hey. You’ve got to give us back our gold.

“We have these contracts. We gave you the gold. The sixty years is up. Give us back the gold!”

<strong>DW</strong>: Why would they have waited four years? Why 1998?

<strong>SEVEN SHIPLOADS OF CHINESE GOLD WERE SENT TO THE US IN 1938</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: 1938 was when the seven shiploads of gold was sent to the United States from China.

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh!

<strong>BF</strong>: There were many shipments, but in 1938, seven battleships evacuated Chinese gold from China to the United States to avoid it being taken by the Japanese.

They gave the Chinese all these Federal Reserve Board bonds, promising to give the gold back in 60 years.

<strong>DW</strong>: Is there any recorded history of that?

<strong>BF</strong>: Oh yeah! The Chinese have elaborate documentation, which is why this whole lawsuit is taking place.

<strong>DOCUMENTS WILL BE PUBLIC DOMAIN ONCE THE LAWSUIT COMES OUT</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Is any of that documentation public domain, though? …Yet.

<strong>BF</strong>: It’s all going to be there in that lawsuit, so it’s public domain once it goes into the lawsuit.

I’ve seen lots of pictures. I don’t know, I’m not an expert in arcane bonds, but…

<strong>DW</strong>: Right, but as a financial journalist you have certainly had contacts with economists.

Would the average Western economist have known about these shipments in 1938?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah, that would have been headline news. I’m sure if you go back to a newspaper archive, you would find stories about it.

<strong>DW</strong>: Terrific. OK, great.

<strong>BF</strong>: This is something you can find. Just go to an archive. I’m sure you’ll find stories about Chinese gold being evacuated.

[<strong>DW</strong>: More research is needed to prove this online – however, the following link makes it clear that the Japanese invasion did come to a ferocious head in 1937-38:

<a href="http://www.san.beck.org/21-5-ChinaatWar1937-49.html">http://www.san.beck.org/21-5-ChinaatWar1937-49.html</a>]

<strong>THE US MILITARY PROTECTED CHINESE GOLD FROM THE JAPANESE</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So this was done by the US military to protect the Kuomintang gold from the Japanese army.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes.

<strong>DW</strong>: …Which was actually the Rothschilds.

<strong>BF</strong>: Let’s leave all that stuff out for now.

<strong>DW</strong>: Okay.

<strong>THE KUOMINTANG SUED FOR THE RETURN OF THEIR GOLD IN 1998</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The point is that in 1998, the Chinese owners of the gold sued the Federal Reserve Board, and said “Give us back our gold.”

<strong>THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAID 200,000 TONS GIVEN IN THE 70s HAD BEEN ENOUGH</strong>

The Federal Reserve Board people argued that they didn’t have to give back the gold.

[They said they had paid in full] because they gave a bunch of gold to Chairman Mao in the 1970s when the United States renewed relations with communist China.

<strong>DW</strong>: Could you be more technical than what you said… “a bunch?” What are we talking, here?

<strong>BF</strong>: Two hundred thousand tons?

<strong>DW</strong>: Geez. But two hundred thousand tons is not going to fill seven battleships.

<strong>BF</strong>: That’s the point. They lost the case.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>THE FIRST GOLD SHIPMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SEPTEMBER 12, 2001</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The International Court of Justice said “You guys have to give back the gold you took.”

They said “Okay.” The first shipment of gold they were supposed to give back was due to be sent back on September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2001.

<strong>DW</strong>: Jesus Christmas!

<strong>BF</strong>: And of course, as you know, the World Trade Center got blown up on September 11<sup>th</sup>.

The gold that was in the basement went missing.

<strong>ALL THE PAPERS AND THE EMPLOYEES HANDLING THEM WERE DESTROYED</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, the company that was handling the paperwork, was blown up – and all 600 of their employees were killed.

<strong>DW</strong>: Was that in Building 7?

<strong>BF</strong>: No, this was in [one of] the [two main] World Trade center building[s].

Building 7, where the Treasury police and all these people were, was blown up – and all the paperwork there was blown up.

Basically, they were saying, “We’re not giving back the gold!”

<strong>WAS THIS PLANNED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE WTC?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: It leads one to reason that if charges were placed in the World Trade Center when it was constructed – I believe it was constructed in the 1970s, right?

<strong>BF</strong>: Look, I don’t want to… there was plenty of evidence.

President Bush’s brother was in charge of security at the World Trade Center. There was all sorts of construction going on there.

<strong>DW</strong>: I’m just trying to think with the audience here. We’re talking really fast, and some of these things are just going to make them go head over heels.

They’re going to be reeling when they hear this.

You are exposing an absolutely incredible through-line that shows more compellingly than any other motive I’ve ever heard of why, specifically, did the World Trade Center come down.

<strong>THE GOLD WAS SHIPPED TO CALIFORNIA, THEN TO PARAGUAY</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: There was this massive gold cache underneath the World Trade Center, and they snuck it out – I guess by some kind of railroad tracks or something, right, on a train?

<strong>BF</strong>: It was shipped to California and then I believe to Paraguay.

<strong>THE KUOMINTANG KNEW THEY HAD BEEN CHEATED</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh my God. So China must have known they got rolled. When they saw the World Trade Center come down, they must have suspected something immediately!

<strong>BF</strong>: Of course they knew! They said “These bastards aren’t going to pay us back. They’re trying to start World War III.”

<strong>DW</strong>: Holy cow!

<strong>BF</strong>: And what happened was they quintupled the US military budget with this fake War on Terror.

<strong>THE PATRIOT ACT WAS IDENTICAL TO THE NAZI CONSTITUTION</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. And you’ve got this Patriot Act, which is five inches thick of paper that just spontaneously showed up.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah, which is identical to the Nazi constitution, OK?

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh my God.

[<strong>DW</strong>: I apologize for not using more interesting exclamatory phrases, but I had honestly not heard many of these things before!]

<strong>THEY WANTED TO START A NUCLEAR WAR AND SET UP MARTIAL LAW</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: And more to the point is that they had this… and there’s a lot of insider evidence about this.

They had this plan to start this whole Gog and Magog thing again.

This time the plan involved starting a limited nuclear war between Iran and Israel.

They were going to use that war as an excuse to set up martial law in the G7 countries.

<strong>DW</strong>: What’s the timeframe you are talking about for when this was being planned?

<strong>BF</strong>: They’ve been trying it for quite a long time now – ever since 2001, even before.

<strong>CABAL WAS TRYING TO CREATE WORLD WAR III, POST-9/11</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So just to set up the chessboard now, we’re post-9/11.

The Chinese know that they’ve been rolled – that this gold has once again been stolen.

China wants to get their gold back. In the meantime, the Rockefeller faction in the US…

<strong>BF</strong>: They’re building up their military. They’re trying to get the Western countries on a full, militarized basis to prepare for World War III.

<strong>DW</strong>: And what’s that going to do for them? They want to reduce population and they want to wipe out the Chinese?

<strong>BF</strong>: And they don’t want to lose control. They don’t want to lose power. They still have their Messianic, fascist, cultist beliefs that they are destined to rule humanity.

The Israeli newspapers openly referred to China and Russia and Iran as Magog, and the G5 and G7 as Gog.

They were trying to get all these countries to kill each other. They were trying to start World War III.

I’ve seen a map where they were trying to divide China into six countrIes.

<strong>DW</strong>: Like balkanize it. Yeah.

<strong>BF</strong>: Post-World War III.

<strong>THE PENTAGON REALIZED 90 PERCENT OF HUMANITY WOULD DIE – INCLUDING THEM</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What happened was that the Pentagon realized through their game scenarios that if they started all-out World War III, 90 percent of humanity would die – including most of them.

So they didn’t want to go along with it.

<strong>THE PENTAGON HAS SYSTEMATICALLY SABOTAGED THESE PLANS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: They constantly prevented attacks on Iran. They stopped Israeli air raids.

They invaded Georgia to stop an Israeli attack on Iran from there.

They didn’t want to start World War III, because they realized it was insanity.

<strong>DW</strong>: You’re talking about the South Ossetia war now?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. That was an Israeli air base that was designed to attack Iran and start this whole thing.

<strong>DW</strong>: Oh, wow.

<strong>BF</strong>: It’s truly crazy stuff, but the evidence is right there in front of your eyes. Like I said, the Israeli newspapers openly talked about it – in Haaretz, and places like that.

<strong>THE ASIAN SECRET SOCIETIES SET UP A STING OPERATION</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What happened now was a counter-plot. They sent these people to cash a trillion dollars’ worth of these bonds that were given to them by the Feds.

<strong>DW</strong>: So [when you say “They”,] you’re saying now that the Asian Secret Societies.

[They] control enough gold that if it were repatriated, it would be thousands of trillions of dollars – that’s what it says in the legal document…

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes.

<strong>DW</strong>: They created a sting operation with these guys…

<strong>BF</strong>: Together with the CIA guys who they used to work with in Southeast Asia.

<strong>DW</strong>: Who don’t want the Powers that Were to still be running the show.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. They realized they were insane and incompetent. They were one level below these guys and knew that they were crazy.

<strong>PLENTY OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE BONDS SCANDAL</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: When we write this up and we have this all transcribed on my website, I’m going to embed videos for people and the original articles on Bloomberg.com.

[These articles and videos] demonstrate the mainstream media – to a limited degree, because hardly anybody would touch this story – saying that these guys were detained on the border in Italy, I believe, with 134.5 billion dollars in 1934 bonds. Right?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yes.

[<strong>DW:</strong> As I revealed at the beginning of this article, the first thing you want to watch is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttSmZknU9mI&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">this Fox News report</a>, from Glenn Beck, about the scandal.

<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ayy1QKcwcGN0" target="_blank">Here</a> is the original Bloomberg article on the scandal.

<a href="http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=15456&amp;size=A" target="_blank">Here</a> is an Asia Times article on the issue, which has a lot more detail:

<strong>NEITHER YAMAGUCHI NOR WATANABE WERE HELD BY ITALIAN POLICE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Now this is very important. There are a couple things you need to let people realize when they try to create disinformation about this.

<strong>DW</strong>: OK, great.

<strong>BF</strong>: The guys’ names… I have talked to both of them. Yamaguchi and Watanabe.

I was involved because I got called by the P2 Freemason lodge. I talked to some of the Italian Treasury police who arrested them.

First of all, they said the bonds were forgeries – but neither Yamaguchi nor Watanabe were arrested. They were let go.

<strong>THERE IS NO RECORD OF A TRIAL</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Then the Italians said that there was a trial, but there is no record of a trial.

<strong>THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE BONDS BEING OFFICIALLY CONFISCATED</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: There is no record of these bonds being officially confiscated.

<strong>EVIDENCE THAT BERLUSCONI TRIED TO CASH THEM</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: We do have evidence that Prime Minister Berlusconi tried to cash them.

<strong>HEAD OF THE U.N. ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO GIVE 100-MILLION-DOLLAR BRIBE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: We do have evidence that Ban Ki-Moon, the head of the UN, came forward and said “We’ll give you 100 million dollars to go away and forget about this whole thing.”

[<strong>DW</strong>: This is incorrect. Keenan emailed me after this was posted and said it was Giancarlo Bruno who offered a one-time payment of 100 million.]

<strong>DW</strong>: Jesus.

<strong>THE DAVOS WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM WAS ALSO INVOLVED</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: We have the Davos World Forum [as well].

<strong>EVERYONE WAS FOLLOWED AND RECORDED</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: In other words, we can prove that the head of the UN, the UN, the Davos World Forum and Prime Minister Berlusconi, among others, were involved in this theft.

And that’s a provable case, OK?

These people [such as Berlusconi, Ban-Ki Moon and others] were followed.

They were recorded. They were videotaped.

This is all provable in a court of law – which is why we went through a lawsuit.

<strong>BONDS WERE MADE TO LOOK FRAUDULENT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: OK, but let’s get one thing clear, though. These bonds were generated in 1934, by the Federal Reserve.

But, in 1934 they made sure that if China ever actually tried to use these bonds, they would appear fraudulent when they were attempted to be cashed.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. There are deliberate typos. And the numbers themselves are astronomical.

<strong>371 TRILLION DOLLARS OF DRAGON FAMILY GOLD AND TREASURE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: You’ve got to understand that there are two financial systems in the world.

The stuff that’s on the books, in there, according to the official government statistics, the world GDP is 63 trillion dollars, right?

<strong>DW</strong>: Mm hm.

<strong>BF</strong>: And then we have these bonds that are supposedly worth 371 trillion dollars.

There’s a disconnect.

<strong>DW</strong>: What bonds are worth 371 trillion?

<strong>BF</strong>: The total amount held by the Dragon Family. The 85 percent of the world’s gold and treasure. That’s how much it was assessed at.

<strong>DW</strong>: OK. So this is the stuff that was blacklisted – prior to Bretton Woods.

[<strong>DW</strong>: Keith Scott, one of Fulford's insiders, told me he has repeatedly tried to correct Ben on this point, as the 371 trillion was only the value of one large treasure site in Malaysia. The full number is in the many thousands of trillions.]

<strong>POWER OF ATTORNEY GIVEN TO NEIL KEENAN AND KEITH SCOTT</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: This is what Sukarno’s nephew gave us power of attorney to sue over.

<strong>DW</strong>: And that power of attorney was specifically given to Neil Keenan, as cited in your document.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah, and Keith Scott. That [power of attorney was granted] just to say “Hey, you guys stole gold and treasure that doesn’t belong to you.”

[<strong>DW</strong>: Obviously, one trillion dollars’ worth of bonds is only a very small percentage of the total Dragon Family / Kuomintang asset base.

Later, Fulford clarifies that this is not intended to put Keenan and Scott in charge… it is only intended to open the door. However, it is true that Keenan and Scott have complete signatory control over the missing, stolen bonds until 2020.]

<strong>LAWSUIT CREATES THE LEGAL RIGHTS TO OPEN THE “BLACK SCREENS”</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What makes this lawsuit scary to the people who run the financial system is they have the legal right now to open what is known as a “Black Screen.”

This is esoteric stuff. You’ve got to remember that 95 percent of the money in the world exists only as numbers in a computer. Only five percent of it exists as cash money.

<strong>DW</strong>: That’s like most people’s bank account too, right? Unless you withdraw the money, it’s just in a computer.

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. But otherwise what you get is a book entry with numbers.

<strong>DW</strong>: Sure.

<strong>BF</strong>: There’s high-level codes that allow you to punch in… you go through the secret stuff, you punch in your access code and whatever.

Then you type in a billion dollars, and bingo – there’s a billion dollars.

<strong>THE SABBATEANS DON’T WANT TO GIVE UP THE FINANCIAL CONTROL</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Now that’s a pretty nice little thing to have your hands on. You can see why these guys don’t want to give it up.

<strong>DW</strong>: These guys meaning the Western powers.

<strong>BF</strong>: Not the Western powers, but the Sabbateans who are above and behind the Western powers.

I’m talking about the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds and all these kinds of people.

<strong>THE BLACK SCREENS ARE THE CURRENT VERSION OF BRETTON WOODS</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: So these black screens are part of the same financial system that was created by Bretton Woods.

<strong>BF</strong>: It’s the current version. It’s the ultimate high-tech computer network where the money is all supposedly hidden.

<strong>QUINTILLIONS OF ILLICIT DOLLARS HAVE BEEN CREATED</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The problem is because no one was in charge at the top, and there was no agreement, different groups started creating ridiculous numbers.

I’ve heard that there are now quintillions of dollars that they’ve tried to put into the system.

<strong>DW</strong>: I’ve heard that as well.

<strong>BF</strong>: And that’s like 33 orders of magnitude more than there is of real world economy.

So the system is broken. It has mathematically malfunctioned at the highest level.

<strong>PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS FACILITATE TRADES BETWEEN CENTRAL BANKS</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Now one of the insider things that I have heard… it’s something I’ve never said publicly before, but it’s an important point.

It’s my understanding that as a result of Bretton Woods, central banks were forbidden from directly trading with one another.

They had to have civilian intermediaries who were actually the bond holders – who actually kept the equity in their own private accounts.

Part of Bretton Woods was that these people were supposed to deposit 80 percent of the yield, as this money was created out of thin air, into humanitarian relief programs.

Would you agree with that?

<strong>BF</strong>: I have heard something along those lines. And I know at least a couple of people who do this trading between governments.

[I know] one of 20 people at the BIS who are authorized to do this stuff. I talk directly to them.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>THE MONEY WAS STOLEN – NOT USED FOR HUMANITARIAN CAUSES</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The problem is that if they open these screens – and we have the access codes now – they will realize that the money wasn’t used mostly for humanitarian purposes.

It was stolen and used for military-industrial purposes.

<strong>WHAT ABOUT THE “BOOK OF MAKLUMAT” FROM SUHARTO?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: When you say “open the black screens,” is that the equivalent of what you were calling the Book of Maklumat that came from Suharto in Indonesia?

<strong>BF</strong>: The Book of Maklumat is one of several physical account entries that would allow people to open up this can of worms and prove that money was stolen.

<strong>DW</strong>: Is there one copy of it only?

<strong>BF</strong>: No, there are many copies of it hidden all over the place now, of course, because it’s such a sensitive issue.

[<strong>DW</strong>: After this interview, I was able to see a digital copy of the Book of Maklumat. It definitely did not strike me as fraudulent. Most of it was a very detailed accounting of the staggering number of assets being held, with all the code numbers and descriptions.]

<strong>THEN WHO HAS THE JURISDICTION TO GO AFTER THEM?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: But who has the jurisdiction to go after these guys? That’s one of the problems with this.

<strong>BF</strong>: That’s the problem! We are in kind of uncharted territory. We don’t have the structures right now.

The United Nations are run by a bunch of gangsters. A lot of the world leaders have been bribed and blackmailed into obeying these people.

So what’s happening is we are entering into a kind of vacuum. We need to set up new structures, new systems, a new way of running the planet.

<strong>THE EURO AND THE IMF ARE BANKRUPT</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: But if the Euro and the dollar become bankrupt, people are going to be really pissed – and those changes could happen pretty quickly.

<strong>BF</strong>: The Euro is already bankrupt. You can see the IMF, which is supposedly the highest financial body on Earth, is saying they don’t have any money.

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs] That’s scary.

<strong>BF</strong>: When Russia was bankrupt, it was the IMF that bailed them out. And now the so-called IMF doesn’t have money.

That’s because they don’t have a legal mandate. It expired in 1994. They’re just a bunch of people claiming to have the right. No one gave it to them.

<strong>THE NON-ALIGNED NATIONS HAVE BLACKLISTED ALL BUBBLE MONEY</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: That means these non-aligned nations you’re referring to, they are not accepting the bubble money that’s being created in the computers anymore?

They are not accepting that equity?

<strong>BF</strong>: It’s all being blacklisted – kept out of the system.

That’s why the dollar hasn’t… you haven’t had hyperinflation in the United States. That money is not being put into the system.

Otherwise, all these numbers announced by the Fed – if you do the math, there should be hyperinflation, but there isn’t – because it’s not being allowed into the system.

It is a mess – but here’s the real point.

<strong>CREATING MONEY ALLOWS US TO SHAPE THE FUTURE WE WANT TO LIVE IN</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The creation of money, in a way, is the process of deciding what we as a species will do in the future.

And it’s being controlled by religious fanatics who wanted to carry out Old Testament prophecies. It’s really wacko and mind-boggling.

Most of us ordinary humans, like any Miss America candidate, or pretty well any guy you pick off the street, will say, “End poverty, stop environmental destruction, and make everyone rich and happy.” Stuff like that.

It’s not rocket science. What we want in the future is not what the current set of leaders has in mind.

They want World War III and killing four billion people, and the rule of an elite over a slave population. We don’t want that!

<strong>COULD THIS MASSIVE GOLD SUPPLY PROVIDE COLLATERAL FOR A NEW ECONOMY?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: We’ve revealed something in this interview that I’ve never heard you say publicly before.

The amount of gold that is here [is huge]… all of the confiscating of the Roman Empire, [as well as the Spanish conquistadores,] pulled it out of these ancient places where it already was.

It somehow all made its way over to China because of silk trading, and this and that, and opium.

<strong>BF</strong>: [crosstalk] Asia. Asia. Spice, silk, ceramics…

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. So there’s this massive amount of gold that could put us back on a gold standard, where currency is tethered to something of real value.

<strong>A NEW “GOLD STANDARD” CENTRALIZES CONTROL TOO MUCH</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The problem with a gold standard, if you talk to the people… and one group that supported us are the people who used to control the gold.

As far as they’re concerned, the “Golden Rule” is “He who has the gold… makes the rules.”

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs]

<strong>BF</strong>: Well, that’s not really a viable alternative to fiat money, if you ask me.

<strong>DW</strong>: True.

<strong>FULFORD SUPPORTS MULTIPLE GROUPS TO PLAN THE FUTURE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What I personally support is we need multiple different groups that have some kind of planning function into the future.

Whatever they do has to be based on stuff that exists in the real world.

There is a discipline in reality that you cannot escape. If you grow wheat, that wheat exists. And then you can put out a receipt that says “This is good for wheat.”

But, if you just put out a receipt that is backed by nothing, it doesn’t exist. It’s just a fact of nature.

<strong>JAPAN HAD EXCELLENT SUCCESS WITH ECONOMIC PLANNING AGENCIES</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What I’ve supported… I came here in the 80s when Japan was number one. It was the country of the future.

They had a system which I thought was the best we’ve seen so far on this planet.

They had what was known as an economic planning agency. They would draw an idea of where we want to be as a country five years from now.

Everyone would be consulted. People would say we want more roads, we want more sewage, we want more schools, we want a space station, whatever.

Then they would draw up plans. The Bank of Japan would go around and figure out how much money they could print that was backed by real stuff, without causing inflation.

Backed by real stuff means real estate, gold, rice, anything real. Then private industry would actually carry it out.

<strong>TEN PERCENT GROWTH PER YEAR – AND ECONOMIC EQUALITY</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What they had was fast economic growth, for decades – close to ten percent a year.

They had the lowest gap between the poor and the rich in any developed country, and probably any country on Earth.

<strong>AMERICANS FORCED THEM TO DISMANTLE THE SYSTEM</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: It was the Americans who came in and bullied them and forced them to dismantle that system.

This is why they’ve had stagnation for the past 23 years.

<strong>THE CHINESE ARE STILL USING A SIMILAR MODEL – AND ARE GROWING</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The Chinese are still using a system similar to the old Japanese system, which is why they still have fast economic growth!

<strong>DW</strong>: Wow. Okay.

<strong>DEMOCRATICALLY DECIDE WHAT PEOPLE WANT – AND FIND A WAY TO DO IT</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: So what I’m saying is that you need some people who are selected because they are very smart, because they passed a good exam, who are given the job of carrying out people’s wishes in a realistic manner.

So everybody says “This is what we want the world to be in five years.” Then these guys try to make it real by focusing on numbers and stuff that can actually be done.

Now I’m not saying we want a single planning agency for the whole planet. I’m saying this could be one of many competing groups trying to create new projects for the future.

The CIA guys and these people I talk to, and the Rothschild faction that is helping us, they want their own new offshore centers where they can carry out their own plans and projects for the planet.

And that’s fine.

[<strong>DW</strong>: Elsewhere, Fulford has made it clear that this would only be allowed if they worked on projects that did not harm the planet or its people – and they would need to be monitored carefully.]

<strong>MONEY HAS TO BE BASED ON REAL THINGS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: I don’t think we want a centralized control network. But we do need to make sure that anything that does exist is disciplined by reality.

It has to be based in something real.

The system should be that if someone takes a log and carves it into a totem pole, they have created money.

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs] Yeah.

<strong>BF</strong>: It shouldn’t be some guy with a computer, some powerful oligarch with a computer punching numbers and acting like God – which is what we have now.

<strong>THE WESTERN COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN GETTING MORE THAN GIVING</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The other thing, of course, is that if you look at reality right now, the fact of the matter is that the European countries, the United States and Australia have been getting more stuff from the rest of the world than they have been giving.

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. The only export they have is “Financial Products,” which is basically bubble money.

<strong>BF</strong>: And weapons.

<strong>SUPPRESSED TECHNOLOGIES COULD CREATE AN INCREDIBLE NEW CIVILIZATION</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The United States has the world’s best universities still. They have a very intelligent, well-educated, hardworking population.

And, they have all this high tech that has been suppressed for so-called national security reasons.

So if we can get these scumbags out of power in the Federal Reserve Board and free the people, the potential for a boom such as has never been seen before is right there. It’s ready!

<strong>THE CABAL IS FIGHTING TO THE BITTER END</strong>

But first, we have to let the old system collapse. These guys are not going to go quietly into the night. They are threatening war still. They are still trying to attack Iran.
I’ve had reports now that they are planting nuclear bombs in the seabed off the shore of Tokyo to create another tsunami here.

<strong>DW</strong>: Jesus.

<strong>BF</strong>: They’re up to all sorts of nasty stuff. And we have to stop them.

<strong>WHAT ABOUT THE PENTAGON CONDUCTING MASS ARRESTS?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Now you’ve said before that one of the enforcement arms that could come into play, now that you’ve driven the wedge with this lawsuit, is the Pentagon.

The good guys in the Pentagon could at some point actually do mass arrests at gunpoint of, as you’ve said, I believe most of the House of Representatives and the Senate.

[This is] because these guys have private accounts in the Vatican Bank and they have been bribed, right?

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah.

<strong>DW</strong>: You’re [also] talking about the heads of the top five media companies that have been controlling the media to promote this agenda.

These guys [in the Pentagon] are preparing to move on that at some point, right?

<strong>NO ONE HAS FORMED A CONSENSUS OF WHAT TO DO, OR WHEN TO DO IT</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: They’re not quite sure what to do next. That’s the problem. There’s a lot of confusion. It’s one thing to say “All right, let’s put these guys in jail” – but then they say, “Well, now what?”

There’s no coherent plan in place for what’s next. Keenan and his people have their ideas. I’ve got mine. Other people have their own plans they’re all pushing.

What I do believe, though, is that yes – you do need to get the out-and-out criminals out of power. Put them under house arrest. You don’t have to put them in jail.

<strong>CHANGE THE TOP OF THE PYRAMID</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Most of them… it’s one of those systems. I don’t know if you’ve seen the movie The Scorpion King.

It’s one of those movies where you come in to the top of the pyramid, you beat the guy in a swordfight, you show up at the top of the stairs with his head in hand and everybody bows down to you. [Growling voice:] “OHHHHH!”

<strong>DW</strong>: [Laughs]

<strong>BF</strong>: Most of these guys are used to that pyramid system. If you change the top, they automatically go along with the new program.

They say “Hey, I was just following the pharaoh”, you know?

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>BF</strong>: So it could be a system where you don’t even have to put anybody in jail. You just say “OK, we’ve changed the plan now. There’s a new game plan. Now instead of building pyramids, you’re going to be building universities.”

And they say, “OK, let’s go for it!”

<strong>OBAMA HASN’T BEEN ABLE TO RESIST THE PRESSURE GROUPS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: But, having said that, there are a lot of incompetent gangsters at the highest levels of power who shouldn’t be there. They don’t know how to run a country and they don’t know how to run a planet.

And they don’t belong in that job. And I mean Obama among others. His record proves it!

<strong>DW</strong>: I think he’s folded way too many times to the pressure groups around him.

<strong>BF</strong>: Well, he’s just a puppet. That’s the fact of the matter.

<strong>WE NEED TO HAVE AN OPEN DEBATE ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What we do need to have, as quick as possible, is an open debate. We want to get everybody in on it, so that we can say, “What are we going to do next?”

It’s one thing to get rid of the old system, but if you don’t have anything ready in place, you end up with chaos.

You end up with a loss of civilization. You end up with collapse of order.

That’s one thing we all agree we don’t want.

There has got to be a transition towards a better way of running the planet that’s not going to destroy, but build.

<strong>WE DON’T EXACTLY HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO FIGURE THIS ALL OUT…</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: I don’t mean to play devil’s advocate here, but [you have said] the Asian Secret Societies and the non-aligned nations have put this squeeze play [on the Western economy.]

[Now,] as of our interview, November 28<sup>th</sup>, there’s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2068138/Britain-joins-multi-billion-pound-global-bailout-key-banks-face-new-credit-crunch.html" target="_blank">stuff in the news</a> saying the Euro isn’t even going to last ten days.

<strong>DW</strong>: [That means] we don’t have a lot of time to make those decisions.

People are going to start suffering when these collapses that you guys apparently have helped to engineer finally happen.

<strong>THEY ARE ACTING LIKE HITLER AT THE END OF WWII</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Unfortunately, because the people in power in the United States, in Washington, in Wall Street and in Europe are being very stubborn, they are acting like Hitler was at the end of World War II:

“I will let Germany collapse before I will move from power.”

There is going to be a really tough winter in the United States and in Europe as things stand now.

These guys are not going peacefully and quietly into the night. They are not accepting that we need a fundamental change in how we run this planet.

That is why it is going to be a tough winter unless you hurry up and get these guys out.

<strong>THERE WILL BE VERY POWERFUL DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Well, they’re going to have incredibly powerful disinformation campaigns that will do everything they can to make you appear to be a fool, and that everything you are saying is a lie.

<strong>BF</strong>: Sure!

[<strong>DW</strong>: These groups know the war is fought in public opinion – so strong efforts are being made to pose as ordinary people writing comments on blogs and discussion forums.

Two scientists at the Canadian University of Victoria investigated the problem of the “paid armies” of fake commenters in China. They <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/arxiv/27357/?p1=blogs" target="_blank">created software</a> that was 85-percent successful at weeding them out.

India Daily posted <a href="http://indiadaily.com/editorial/22740.asp" target="_blank">an article</a> that clearly asserts that China is not the only group “flooding” the Internet this way – hence the name “Internet Water Army”.

The Internet Water Army is a group of individuals who act as paid mercenaries to inundate the Internet with comments, gossip, or other content to build up or demolish credibility of articles, information, Websites and more.

These people demolish the consumer ranking of products and services, create false images, provide a sense of false perception to destroy the truth.

Some blame China as the pioneer of the Internet Water Army. China may be using the same but the list of abusers is vast. It is very common in the free world.

The corporations are employing them, the unions are employing them, and even the political parties employ them.

The Internet Water Army are typically tasked with registering on a Web site and then producing content in the form of posts, articles, links to sites and videos, etc.]

<strong>THEY WILL ARGUE THAT THIS IS THE “NEW WORLD ORDER” EVERYONE IS FEARING</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: [They will strongly argue] that if this [Asian] group actually succeeds, it’s the New World Order, it’s the Illuminati, it’s fascism, martial law, FEMA camps and all the things they’ve been trying to get people afraid of.

So how do you counter that?

<strong>THEY WON’T BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO CREATE PROPAGANDA ANYMORE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: The reality of the situation is stronger than the propaganda.

They can talk all they want. They say “Well, now I’ve got a quadrillion dollars. A quintillion dollars. See, it’s in my computer!”

Then go try to spend it. See what happens! See how far you get with that!

Bush was trying to flee to Paraguay, and they stopped him.

See what happens when he takes his black card, or whatever they have, and he goes to the store, and they say “Sorry. You can’t buy anything.”

These guys will be just street trash once their money is frozen. And it’s being frozen.

<strong>LOTS OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON NOW</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Right now you’re saying there isn’t really a consensus within the Pentagon as to when or if to do these so-called mass arrests.

<strong>BF</strong>: I don’t know. What I do know is these Pentagon people always told me they are waiting for this lawsuit to be a trigger.

Now there’s a lot of, “OK, well, it’s there. We understand that the system is rotten and broken, but we’re not quite sure what to do next.”

There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes negotiating and talking and running around.

As things stand, unfortunately it looks like things are going to have to get more chaotic before these people’s minds are concentrated enough that they’re ready to start building new systems, new agreements to share this planet.

<strong>A FIFTY-FIFTY SPLIT BETWEEN “EAST” AND “WEST”</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: The basic [idea] that I have said as an operating principle is that Western and Asian civilization need to start out with an exactly 50-50 deal that underlines whatever it is that we start building on top of the old system.

We don’t want, suddenly, Europeans and Americans to be taking orders from Asians. And the Asians are tired of having the Europeans tell them what to do.

We need to have a forum where we reach a consensus. We both agree, “Yes, that’s a good idea.”

Build a space colony? “Yes, that’s a good idea.”

<strong>WHERE DO THE ISLAMIC COUNTRIES FIT INTO THIS?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: What side would all the Islamic countries be in that 50/50?

<strong>BF</strong>: The Islamic countries are basically with us, except for a few colonies that are still controlled by the cultists, pretending to be Muslims.

Essentially, they’re just afraid of ending up the way Khadafi did, so they are keeping their heads low – but they are essentially with us.

<strong>DW</strong>: Okay.

<strong>HELP THE JEWISH PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE CORRUPTION OF LEADERSHIP</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: What we really need to do now is to get the Jewish people to realize that their leaders, a lot of them, were a part of an insane cult.

They shouldn’t allow those people to speak for them as a people. These are the same people behind the Holocaust, you know?

<strong>DW</strong>: Right. The atrocity is too boggling for most people’s minds to even wrap around.

<strong>BF</strong>: Exactly. That’s what they were counting on. It’s just too big for people to wrap their minds around.

But all this is provable, you know?

<strong>DW</strong>: Right.

<strong>VERIFYING THE LAWSUIT AS AUTHENTIC</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: One thing I want to make sure we cover before we would end this interview is this presentation of this legal document.

The law firm that is listed on the document is Bleakley, Platt and Schmidt LLP, in White Plains, New York.

The principal attorney behind it is William H. Mulligan, Jr.

I’ve been to their website. They are definitely a very bonafide legal firm. I haven’t actually called them yet, but I plan on calling Mulligan and asking him just to verify that this suit is real.

[<strong>DW</strong>: I did call Mulligan and speak to him on the phone. Please do not bother him. He released an official, recorded statement via my colleague Kimberley Jaeger confirming the lawsuit is genuine, as you hear at the end of the MP3 of our interview.]

<strong>THIS DOCUMENT SHOULD HELP CONVINCE THE SKEPTICS</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: It’s a hyper-complex document. It’s loaded with numbers, documentation, with names.

I’m still on the receiving end of tons of hateful comments people are directing towards you.

[<strong>DW</strong>: Paid bloggers… Water Army crusaders… we love you! Think about what you’re doing and who you’re supporting, as you have to live here too!]

I hope this document will do a lot to allay those concerns – because it is very comprehensive.

<strong>THE PEOPLE BEHIND THE LAWSUIT ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES DOING THIS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: You’ve got to remember [this].

The people behind that lawsuit are an important group within the West that support a move towards a more sane international financial system – but they are not the only group out there.

A lot of people know that something needs to be done.

<strong>THERE IS CHAOS – PEOPLE DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO NEXT</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: Like I say, it’s a situation right now.

My understanding is that chaos is the best word to describe what is happening right now within the leadership circles of the Western world.

I would even include Japan in that. There’s a lot of confusion. People don’t know what to do next.

<strong>THIS NEEDS TO BECOME PART OF AN OPEN, PUBLIC DEBATE</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: It’s important to have a lot of open debate and truth disclosure, so that people can make informed decisions.

I don’t think this should be handled behind closed doors anymore. I think this should be open to the public.

If people have specific things where they think I am either wrong or crazy, I am happy to answer it.

There is no point responding to slander, but if there are real arguments there, I would be happy to listen to them.

<strong>SOME OF THE LEGAL DOCUMENT WAS SOURCED FROM WIKIPEDIA</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: When I did my due diligence on the document, my biggest concern, which I published on your forum, was that in section 33, there is a series of eight sentences regarding the World Economic Forum.

When I was concerned about whether the document was legitimate, I looked up World Economic Forum on Wikipedia.

The sentences on Wikipedia were almost exactly the same as what is in the legal document.

<strong>BF</strong>: Sure! The guy writing the legal document says, “All right. We know the Davos World Economic Forum [is involved], because there is a tape recording of a conversation with Giancarlo Bruno, who is the head of financial services at the World Economic Forum, [discussing it].”

So we have evidence, forensic evidence, that they are linked.

But then [we say] OK, so what is the World Economic Forum, anyway?

So the lawyer goes to Wikipedia and cuts and pastes eight sentences. Sure. That’s what people do. Even lawyers writing up legal documents.

<strong>CLEARING UP THE ISSUE OF THE “OFFICE OF INTERNATIONAL TREASURY CONTROL”</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: The other mistake that I made publicly, which I want to correct, to your credit, was that in the document, the Office of International Treasury Control was referred to.

I didn’t read the document carefully enough when I wrote my comments to see that in the legal document, the legitimacy of this OITC and its alleged UN charter is challenged. In other words, they attack the OITC.

When you look at the OITC website, it is painfully amateur. It made me have to reload my browser in 32-bit mode. The videos were done in Power Point. There are lots of grammatical errors on the website. It’s a joke!

<strong>BF</strong>: Yeah. It’s a joke. The guy RC Dam, who they supposedly put up as the guy who was in charge, is some Cambodian guy… he’s on the run now. He’s fled. People don’t know where he is.

He was raised by the CIA. He was just a front man.

<strong>A COMPLEX, HIGH-LEVEL FINANCIAL FRAUD INVOLVING FIJI</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: If you actually look up OITC, Office of International Treasury Control on Wikipedia, you read about this massive fraud that these guys – posing as the OITC, which was allegedly where the equity of the world’s banks is being kept – instilled a fraud on Fiji.

They were allegedly going to finance Fiji with billions of dollars – which obviously did not come to pass.

Any conventional con-man would have to have really brass balls to try to defraud an entire country like that!

<strong>BF</strong>: These guys probably realized that the people who actually control the financial system themselves were basing it on fraud. So they were trying to get a piece of the action.

That’s my reading of it. What I do want to emphasize is that even though Keenan and Scott have power of attorney right now, they shouldn’t be put in charge of running the planet.

[<strong>DW</strong>: That is not what they want or expect either, based on my discussions with them.]

<strong>117 NATIONS HAVE AGREED TO SET UP A NEW SYSTEM IN THE MONACO ACCORDS</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: We need an open discussion involving lots of people. That discussion is going to take place at the forum of 117 nations, the Monaco Accords, who have agreed to set up a new financial system.

We need to get the G5 nations and their satellite countries to participate in these discussions, so we can as quickly as possible come up with new global structures to replace the corrupt and rotten UN, World Bank, BIS and IMF with something more representative of the people on Earth.

I don’t mean a global government. I mean a common set of rules for the planet we all share, the air we all breathe and the oceans we all use. Not some centralized New World Order control grid. All right?

<strong>DW</strong>: Absolutely!

<strong>WHAT ABOUT THE MALAYSIAN WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL?</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: Now is the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629438" target="_blank">Malaysian war crimes tribunal that found Bush and Blair guilty of war crimes</a>, is that in any way related to this 117-nation alliance?

<strong>BF</strong>: No. It’s just another sign that humanity is waking up, and they are tired of being controlled by this criminal cabal.

But, no consensus has been come up with about what to do next.

<strong>LOTS OF SUPPORT FOR A NEW ECONOMIC PLANNING AGENCY</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: However, I can say this. There is a lot of support for my idea for a new international economic planning agency to do things like turn the deserts green and replenish the oceans with fish, and stop environmental destruction.

Not as a world government, but simply as some group that carries out big, long-term and large-scale projects for the benefit of the people and the living organisms of this planet.

<strong>DW</strong>: Yeah. And I think that a lot of the people in these groups don’t want to be working for the bad guy. They want to save face.

<strong>BF</strong>: Exactly! They all want to save the planet, so let’s do it!

Listen, I have to go, but thanks for talking to me.

<strong>DW</strong>: I really appreciate it, Ben. This has been a great interview. My prayers and support are with you guys.

<strong>THE LEGAL DOCUMENT DID SAY THE “OITC” WAS FRAUDULENT… AND FAULTS THE U.N.</strong>

<strong>DW</strong>: There was one other thing I just wanted to toss in briefly about the Office of International Treasury Control. And that is that I made a misstatement publicly.

When I went back and read your document, it clearly states that this was a fraudulent organization, but that the UN is at fault because they allowed this organization to prosper without ever publicly refuting their alleged charter.

<strong>BF</strong>: That’s because Ban Ki-Moon himself, the head of the UN, is using fraudulent documents as we talk to try to take over African countries – just as they’re trying to use the same fraudulent documents to take over Europe!

<strong>DW</strong>: My God.

<strong>BF</strong>: Okay? He’s citing “seven families” as his authority. The seven families are the ones who founded the Federal Reserve Board.

And they have no authority! They’re a bunch of crooks and gangsters. And we need to kick the bums out. All right?

<strong>DW</strong>: Thank you very much, Ben.

<strong>END POVERTY, STOP ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION AND CREATE A STAR TREK FUTURE!</strong>

<strong>BF</strong>: I don’t want to end on a bad note. What we really need to do is end poverty, stop environmental destruction, and create a wonderful new future for the planet and the species on it.

<strong>DW</strong>: Well, we’re all behind you, and we look forward to the next update. Thank you so much, Ben.

<strong>BF</strong>: Thank you very much.

<strong>DW</strong>: All right. Take care.

[END OF INTERVIEW]

<strong>PART TWO IS COMING SOON</strong>

What you've just read is quite stunning... but it still turned out to only be the beginning of the story.

I was able to grill Fulford and get a lot more information out of him than I've ever seen before. However, once I made contact with the people involved in this lawsuit, I found out there was much more to the story than what Fulford has reported so far.

In Part Two I will give a proper historical overview of how and why these vast assets were seized and held by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of International Settlements... beginning in 1921 with Emperor Hirohito's trip to the United Kingdom.

This interview was truly just the beginning -- and much of what has delayed me so much in getting this posted has been the process of doing all the follow-up. I decided to break it into two parts so you don't have to keep waiting.

<strong>THE TIMETABLE HAS SPED UP SINCE OUR INTERVIEW</strong>

It is also important to quote a bit of Fulford's two most recent blogs -- as the latest actions by the United States have accelerated the timetable wherein the "mass arrests" may occur:

<a href="http://benjaminfulford.net/2011/12/05/the-us-senate-and-obama-claiming-the-right-to-murder-and-imprison-americans-without-trial-was-a-fatal-mistake/" target="_blank">The US Senate and Obama claiming the right to murder and imprison Americans without trial was a fatal mistake</a> (Dec. 5th)

The word is that the Pentagon, the agencies and the militias are on the brink of taking violent action against President Obama and the Senators who claimed the right to kill and/or indefinitely imprison Americans without trial.

[<strong>DW</strong>: "Violent action" may sound a bit too strong, as all he's talking about here is arrests at gunpoint -- probably without shots ever having to be fired.]

The criminal cabal in Washington D.C. and Wall Street may be able to pretend they are setting up a fascist/totalitarian dictatorship in the US for a while longer, but no serious armed group is going to support them.

The same is true in Europe, where Freemason P2 lodgers and Bilderbergers will make a move towards fascist control this week, and will seem to be on the offensive -- but will ultimately fail.

The simple fact of the matter is that these fascists simply do not have any reality to back up the numbers they are putting into their financial computers to bribe people and hire bully boys.

They are mathematically doomed.

The awareness in the thinking part of the population of Western countries has reached a critical mass. The group that is sitting brainwashed in front of their TVs is irrelevant, because the contents of their TV mind-programming will change once police and the military remove the criminals now occupying the corporate media.

Anyone who still believes there is an ounce of truth or decency in the large corporate media establishments has to ask themselves why these organizations do not write 911 truth or about the murder of 2 million Iraqis or about the vast bribes most top Washington D.C. corporate government officials have received.

They must ask why people are being railroaded into an agenda of war against Iran as a precursor to World War 3.

More than anything else, they need to ask themselves why the so-called governments of the West do not make any serious future plans for the planet other than fomenting war.

In signs of imminent revolution, the Senators who voted to kill and imprison Americans without trial are being confronted in their offices by angry constituents. The military has told Obama to buzz off, which is exactly what he did by running off to Hawaii....

<strong>DECEMBER 12TH -- EVEN MORE INFORMATION</strong>

Earlier today as I write this piece, Fulford just posted his next update into this fascinating, ever-changing story. Here is a small excerpt from his paid blog:

<a href="http://benjaminfulford.net/2011/12/12/cabal-struggles-desperately-to-create-fascist-world-government-as-multiple-criminal-investigations-zero-in-on-them/" target="_blank">Cabal struggles desperately to create fascist world government as multiple criminal investigations zero in on them</a>.

The fascist cabal known as the Bilderbergers, CFR, committee of 300 etc., is desperately and without hope trying to start WW3 and install a fascist world government in an attempt to pre-empt criminal investigations closing in on them from all sides.

Their efforts will fail because the Pentagon and the agencies in the US (with the exception of homeland Gestapo) are preparing to remove them from power, according to CIA and other sources.

For example, multiple investigations are closing in on alleged President Obama, including one for illegally declaring war on Libya. A count among US representatives show the votes necessary to impeach him are there, US law enforcement officials say.

In addition, evidence of bribery and other forms of illegally tampering with government is being compiled against George Soros, among others. There is also a lot going on under and on the surface in Europe, Japan and the Middle East....

In the US, as mentioned last week, the Obama regime has asserted the right to murder and imprison Americans without due process, meaning he has declared the US to be a fascist dictatorship. Again, it looks on the surface like the plans for a world fascist government are proceeding smoothly.

Fortunately for the rest of the human race, the fascist power grab is really just a sign of desperation....

The problem is that almost the entire leadership structure in Washington D.C. is corrupt and compromised, but people in the Pentagon and the agencies are so used to taking orders that they do not know what to do when their leaders become dysfunctional.

For example, there are enough votes in the US Congress and Senate now to impeach Obama, but the problem is nobody can agree on a replacement.

The various corruption investigations against the Obama regime can remove him [and the greater architecture of corruption behind the scenes] from power, but nobody knows what to do next.

The only answer is for the military to set up a temporary government headed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff until the garbage can be removed from Washington D.C. and Wall Street. The military rightly claim that armies are not good at governing. However, they are good at cleaning up a mess -- and restoring constitutional order.

The US military also worry about being able to meet the payroll, but the backers of the new financial system have already promised generous financing to ensure a restoration of US economic might -- and a gradual transition of the military industrial complex into something that can be self-supporting and good for the planet.

<strong>DON'T LET ALL THIS FREAK YOU OUT</strong>

Thirty years' worth of dedicated research into the greatest hidden mysteries of science, and of the Universe, led to the creation of my magnum opus, the encyclopedic The Source Field Investigations, which debuted as a New York Times bestseller in August.

In this work, I reveal compelling proof that life on Earth is being guided by a Universal consciousness I call the Source Field -- the ultimate author of space, time, matter, energy and biological life.

This is no longer a speculative, "woo woo", "New Age" discussion -- it is squarely rooted in a great wealth of scientific facts that have never been fully understood.

The Universe is not a "dead", unthinking and unfeeling void. It is vast, vibrant and full of life -- written directly into the quantum level.

In this book, I reveal that dozens of ancient cultures around the world were given prophecies about a coming Golden Age of peace and prosperity. The focal-point for when this would come about was the year 2012.

Regardless of what else may or may not happen around this time, it is remarkable to see the real-world evidence of this mass, international uprising against the Powers that Were coinciding so neatly with prophecies that are thousands of years old.

<strong>WE ARE BEING GUIDED INTO A GLORIOUS FUTURE -- BY A UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE</strong>

Some people do get it. The Source Field wants to let you know that it exists. Many people have sent in testimonials about the incredible synchronicities that begin happening in their lives once they find out about this stuff.

If you're laughing right now, it's only because you haven't had this happen to you yet. Or, more likely, the 'confirmations' have happened to you, but you simply blow it off.

We all grow up in an educational system that demands we be "right", and punishes us with bad grades and "failure" if we are "wrong." For this same reason, we all have strong conditioning to avoid shame.

Now we have the science to prove that this is not ridiculous nonsense. The case stands perfectly well on its own without the addition of the Fulford / Dragon Family / Keenan material -- but I see all of this as part of one vast, interconnected tapestry.

So many people are living in fear and terror of the future. We now have the science to prove that things are getting better, and in fact they must get better -- it's written into the design of the Universe, and is a fundamental aspect of what we're now going through.

I believe we are being intelligently guided through a planetary awakening at this time -- and as we head into 2012, it seems that the public downfall of the Old World Order will be a key part of that process.

[<strong>UPDATE, NEXT MORNING, DECEMBER 13:</strong> On the same day this article came out, Benjamin Fulford was allegedly detained in a hotel against his will by a "CIA-type group"... and his life may be in danger.

This caused him to miss his appearance on a TV show he was scheduled to be on. The videos are at the end. This could be serious. We pray for Ben's well-being and encourage you to <em>help spread the word.</em> Publicity is protection!

<strong>UPDATE, 12:44 AM SAME NIGHT:</strong> We just found out that Fulford is alive and OK. He may have been held in the hotel for his own protection, but we do not know yet. More information will follow as soon as we get it and will be updated below.

<strong>UPDATE WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 15, 3:48 PM:</strong> I have received a very serious death threat from a highly-placed insider, who told me it would be "a very good idea" for me to release Part Two tonight. I will be working non-stop towards that goal. More at the bottom of the article.

<strong>UPDATE WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 15, 5:43 PM: </strong>To all holders of the Wilcock File: DO NOT attempt to contact me in any way. Your instructions are now included in the most recent update.]

<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/THISISTHEPHOTO.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-17905" title="THISISTHEPHOTO" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/THISISTHEPHOTO-500x351.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="351" /></a>
<em>Our old forms of governance have reached the end of their useful existence, for both rulers and ruled. A democratic revolution is coming. Participate!</em>

<strong>By Stephen James Kerr</strong>

In the two months since Occupy Wall Street began its experiment in direct, democratic dissent, “democracy” of the liberal kind has revealed its bankruptcy to the whole world.

In the last sixty days the neo-liberal, let’s call it the “post-democratic” state, its various organs cooperating across jurisdictions and across national borders, launched a coordinated attack upon our rights to freely assemble, associate and speak.

In Oakland as at UC Davis, the radical violence of the cops was inflicted upon hundreds of the innocent and unarmed, and in Toronto and New York the radical violence of the law proved that under post-democracy, flimsy legal reasoning can be a powerful tool of oppression only so long as we continue to respect liberal, post-democratic legalisms.

We have seen two elected national governments, Greek and Italian, close up shop, transferring business to a new proprietor---the so-called “Troika” of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank.

The abortive decision, quickly reversed, to hold a Greek referendum on the savage austerity measures being imposed upon Greek workers and Greek democracy was a disaster---<em>for the markets.</em>

A military coup was being prepared to prevent it if necessary. But it was not. Greek liberals and social democrats combined to carry out a coup against themselves. No sooner had Papandreou fired the commanding officers of the Greek Army, Navy and Air Force, he himself ran away.

The new Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, named an entire Cabinet with not a single elected representative in it. Bankers, business owners and technocrats were simply parachuted into the government of a “democracy.”

No elections were held to make these two transfers of state power legitimate. In a very real sense, the Italian and Greek states are now under the direct control of central bankers, the people be damned.

But these “technocratic governments” are not a novelty. They merely formalize the longstanding relationships of power. Now we can really see who calls the shots.

In the United States the powers of the US Congress have been devolved to a “Super-Congress” of twelve people with deep connections to the US corporate establishment.

We are witnessing something unprecedented.

Both the 1% and the 99% are realizing that liberal “democracy” holds nothing more for them. They are reaching the same conclusion, albeit based upon two entirely opposite political conclusions.

For the 1%, even the largely pantomime rituals of our “democratic” elections, with all their stage-management and scripting are too risky to their continued accumulation of super-profits to be allowed to continue.

They have come to rely on a guaranteed and ever increasing flow of wealth into their own pockets, from us, to them. Since neo-liberal, structural adjustment “reforms” were imposed upon the world in the 1970s, at the insistence of the corporations, the wages and benefits accruing to the 99% have stopped growing, and the 1% have monopolized the financial wealth and income generated by a growing economy.

The crisis for both the 1% and the rest of us arises in part, from the fact that the economy can no longer continue to grow in absolute size on a finite planet featuring a shrinking common stock of natural capital.

Growth cannot continue on a planet where there is no place left unexploited and nowhere that is not already full of our waste, or full of us. The ongoing orgy of financial speculation---of trillions of dollars of bets on essentially phony “assets” - was the last ditch attempt of the 1% to both delay the onset of the final crisis, and to transform “crisis into opportunity.”

To accommodate an ever more predatory capitalism, liberal “democracy” first had to be structurally adjusted, along with the economy. Elections had to be rigged, political parties hijacked. False flag terror attacks had to be staged, the pre-determined victims blamed.

Nations had to be invaded on false pretexts, the bodies buried. Inalienable civil rights had to be made alienable. Millions had to die. A vomitous river of lies had to be told. All to keep the capitalist balls in the air, all to keep the system limping along.

The capitalism system should have collapsed in 2008. Its life was extended by means of a central bank trick: the creation of an immense amount of new fictitious “wealth” in the form of bank created credit.

But this only made the inevitable reckoning that much more catastrophic. Instead of being used to facilitate production, which would have made the credit economically useful, this credit was used to backstop the insolvent speculators and their derivative bets.

<strong>As of 2011 and 2012 the mask is falling away.</strong>

If the 1% are abandoning liberal democracy because it no longer provides iron-clad guarantees of free profits from their debt slaves, the 99% are looking for new, more participatory democracy because the old, “liberal” kind can no longer protect them from the rapacious greed of the 1%.

It is a very difficult conclusion for many people in liberal “democracies.” It is often a conclusion reached only with extreme reluctance. Rarely is it embraced. But it is no less true for that.

We, especially those of us in the English speaking world, have been educated our whole lives to equate the existing constitutional set-up with democracy.

We have been taught---wrongly---that a system of preference elections, political parties (with a combined membership of less than 2% of the population) and professional politicians is tantamount to democracy.

We are taught---wrongly---that our constitution, our courts of law guarantee our freedoms. In fact, <a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/11/23">only our disobedience of the law, of what Erich Fromm called “irrational authority”, guarantees our freedom</a>.

As the former US President once put it, a constitution is nothing but “a goddamned piece of paper”---at least when those entrusted with enforcing it no longer hold its fundamental principles dear.

We are living in that time, when our own governments have created the apparatus of a police state to maintain their political control. Liberal “democracy” is a sham.

That’s what Ronald Regan’s former Assistant Treasury Secretary calls it. <a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/11/04/on-western-democracy/">Paul Craig Roberts writes:</a>“Every day that passes adds to the fraudulent image of Western Democracy…  it turns out that ‘we have freedom and democracy’ is not supposed to be taken literally. It is merely a propagandistic slogan behind which people are ruled through back-room deals decided by powerful private interests.” He’s right.

The Guardian’s <a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/20/peter-beaumont-democracy-in-crisis">Peter Beaumont declares:</a>“democracy itself is failing.” He’s right.

<a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article29786.htm">Cenk Uygur of the Young Turks</a> declares liberal democracy kaput when lobbyists can openly buy American laws they want drafted. He’s right too.

<a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/1090458--mcquaig-occupy-moves-us-into-a-new-era">Linda McQuaig notes:</a>“democracy has become a hollow shell.” She’s right.

<a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article29783.htm">Glen Greenwald</a>, commenting on the brutal police attack on peaceful passively resisting student protestors at UC Davis, as well as the inhumane treatment of Bradley Manning, describes American “democracy” as “a police state in pure form.” He’s right, and his insight is worthy of further scrutiny:

“The intent and effect of such abuse is that it renders those guaranteed freedoms meaningless. If a population becomes bullied or intimidated out of exercising rights offered on paper, those rights effectively cease to exist. Every time the citizenry watches peaceful protesters getting pepper-sprayed---or hears that an Occupy protester suffered brain damage and almost died after being shot in the skull with a rubber bullet---many become increasingly fearful of participating in this citizen movement, and also become fearful in general of exercising their rights in a way that is bothersome or threatening to those in power. That’s a natural response, and it’s exactly what the climate of fear imposed by all abusive police state actions is intended to achieve: to coerce citizens to “decide” on their own to be passive and compliant---to refrain from exercising their rights---out of fear of what will happen if they don’t.”

It reminds me of Fromm’s insight that <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fear_of_Freedom"> freedom to think and speak only has meaning if one actually has original, self-generated thoughts of one’s own to speak</a>. Freedom to merely repeat the received nostrums of authority, what Fromm calls “heteronomous obedience” is the freedom of a slave to love his chains. Real freedom means the capacity to disobey irrational, external authority.

But the debt slaves are beginning not to fear. Some of us are taking our freedom. The violent, illogical response of the authorities reveals their illegitimacy.

With the occupation camps mostly dismantled, the question arises as to what next. This is where it gets interesting, and where the limitations of the reformists and of liberal democracy to contain the hopes and dreams of Occupy become clear.

The Toronto Star recently ran an opinion piece by the seasoned journalist Olivia Ward with the title, <a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1089694--analysis-will-occupy-movement-find-a-place-in-history">“Will Occupy movement find a place in history</a>?” She offers several potential routes toward such a place.

We can “educate, build a social network, co-opt authority (fat chance of that!), speak to power, agitate for proportional representation (too little too late) and spread the message.” But to what end?

Though her article begins with a story about the beginning of the revolution in Serbia, nowhere does she admit to the possibility that a revolution is what we require here in liberal “democracies.” Nor could she be reasonably expected to openly voice such sentiments in The Star.

But a complete revolution, a complete takeover and dismantling of the Canadian state, and of every other liberal “democracy”, is exactly what we require. We need to have a real democratic revolution.

The democratic revolution is not going to be confined to nation states. It’s going to be both global, and local. The revolution is global because it speaks to the universal need of humanity for freedom, autonomy and independence. It will be local as those universal values find their expression in each community, in its own way.

The democratic revolution has the potential to become the fulfillment of the promise of the Western Enlightenment; the creation of a rational, self-directed society of independent producer-citizens in free association, and a return, ad fontes, towards the ancient sources of participatory democracy. There are encouraging signs that this is happening.

In Greece and Italy and Egypt, in New York, Toronto, and in all of the Occupy protest camps, the direct democracy of the Assembly was put into practice to make decisions. Rule of a simple majority---or of minority parties claiming to represent a majority---was rejected as anti-democratic.

In essence, these assemblies are an open rejection of the fundamental premise of representative, liberal “democracy.”

It’s a dual premise: that assembly democracy is not practical, and that it is not desirable because the people are not fit to rule the state. The Occupy experience, and the experience of months of revolution in Egypt, have put paid to that lie. The liberal state was designed in an age just emerging from domination by the landed gentry.

Most people were still illiterate when our representative institutions were created. But today we enjoy universal literacy and widespread higher education.

As Jefferson put it, “we might as well require a man to wear the suit of clothes which fitted him as a boy, than society to remain under the regimen of its barbarous ancestors.”  We have grown up. Our system of government remains a soiled child.

In Iceland, that other great democratic device, of selection of political offices not by election, but by lottery has produced a new constitution. In 2009, one thousand Icelanders were randomly selected from the voter’s list and met in an assembly called the <a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://vimeo.com/thjodfundur2009">Thjodfundur</a>, the National Assembly.

The Assembly drafted an outline of the guiding principles of a new constitution. The following year a constitutional committee was elected from candidates nominated by the citizens to draft the new constitution. Citizen participation was encouraged through the Internet, where the <a href="http://mathaba.net/go?http://stjornlagarad.is/english/">constitution was essentially crowd sourced</a>.

The participatory nature of Iceland’s renewed democracy is a step in the right direction. The citizen body is taking on the role of legislator.

While not a revolution by itself, the Icelandic constitution is certainly a giant step away from the 18th century liberalism of the US Founders and of the conservatism of Edmund Burke, the two schools of thought to whom Anglo-Saxon “democratic” institutions owe their current forms.

Those forms have reached the end of their useful existence, for both rulers and ruled. A democratic revolution is coming. Participate!

NEW YORK - There is a "suspicion" that the death of the Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi may be called a war crime, Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Luis Moreno Ocampo questioned on this declared on Thursday.

A journalist referred to recent remarks made by Russian PM Putin that "Americans do know much" about Kaddafi's death and that they were possibly involved. Moreno said he is willing to accept useful information on this from all countries.

Another journalist referred to a letter send to Moreno by the  lawyer of Kaddafi's daughter earlier this week.

It stated that Kaddafi and his son Mutassim after their capture "had been murdered in a most horrific manner, after which their bodies were shown and abused in a grotesque way".

"Images of these cruelties went around the world and have brought severe emotional distress to my client", said lawyer Nick Kaufman who represents Aisha Kaddafi.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Yes this has been on the Dutch news today, I've read it too. However, imho there is no need to echo this here as it only builds on other mainstream media stories that has taken over a huge part of the globe since the second half of October; Mathaba is not repeating after or building on those stories. Voor het geval ik hiermee in raadselen spreek, zie bijvoorbeeld http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629132 en de links aan het einde van dit artikel.

I'm glad you're here though and I hope you stay with us, please register at https://social.mathaba.net and see http://www.mathaba.com on how to participate/communicate in other ways. Also, if you notice any news regarding this case: http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=629561 can you please let us know? Thanks. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

ENGLISH = Qaddafi is still alive according to new image
A new image of Qaddafi has been circulating among Libyans through cell phone and social media networks, the image shows Qaddafi with a large beard and still alive.
Muammar Qaddafi was apparently martyred when US bombed his convoy and Nato-mercenaries were sent to finish the job.
As fighting continues around Libya and protests gain momentum, the US agents are being targeted. Khalifa Haftar’s two sons have been injured within few days and he himself survived an assassination attempt.
Mustafa Abdul Jalil tried to resign after surviving an assassination attempt but the occupying regime did not accept his resignation, all traitors and US agents are trying to leave before Libya explodes, meanwhile NATO member states call the destruction and bloodshed in Libya one of their biggest success stories.
================
ITALIANO = Secondo una nuova immagine in circolazione, Gheddafi è ancora vivo.
Una nuova immagine di Gheddafi sta circolando tra i libici sui telefoni cellulari e social networks, e l’immagine mostra Gheddafi con la barba lunga e ancora vivo.
Muammar Gheddafi è stato apparentemente martirizzato quando gli americani hanno bombardato il suo convoglio e mercenari sono stati inviati a finire il lavoro.
Mentre in Libia continuano gli scontri un po’ ovunque e le proteste crescono, gli agenti degli Stati Uniti sono presi di mira. Due figli di Khalifa Haftar sono stati feriti in pochi giorni e lui stesso è sopravvissuto ad un tentativo di assassinio.
Mustafa Abdul Jalil ha cercato di dare le dimissioni dopo essere sopravvissuto ad un attentato, ma il regime d’occupazione non ha accettato le sue dimissioni, e mentre tutti i traditori e gli agenti degli Stati Uniti stanno cercando di lasciare la Libia prima che esploda, le nazioni che fanno parte della NATO definiscono la distruzione e spargimento di sangue in Libia come uno dei loro più grandi successi storici.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Greetings!

Pardon me for saying so, but this strikes me as a bit 'hokey'.  I too suspect and hope that Brother Leader Qaddafi is still alive and well, but a) this picture doesn't look much like him and b) when my grandson came back from Libya in April he told me that no cellphones that show pictures are allowed in Libya - they are illegal.  Circumstances may have changed this, but I'm not sure I trust this 'information'.  Photoshopping is relatively easy and there's still a psy-ops War going on.  Somehow it's a bit too convenient that Col. Qaddafi 'has been dead' all this time and now suddenly that certain parties are being threatened with War Crimes prosecutions, he is 'alive again'.  I for one smell a RAT, lol!
Thanks and Peace!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Dear libyanfreepress people:
We are all incredibly sad about the situation in Libya - and also the ones that appear unfortunately to be developing in Syria and Iran.  Some days we all find it hard to go on, but we must discipline oursleves to stay focused and maintain an even keel somehow.  Part of our revenge, if you will, can be absolutely refusing to get sucked into the sick psy-ops war that these psychopaths never tire of raining onto all concerned people in order to sap their strength and get them to despair.  We can decide that we WILL NOT be part of that but continue with our tasks to inform and comment as best we can.  The Green Resistance needs our support and strength and so we must remain steadfast.  We are all in this together, so here's wishing you all the best!

<em>Qawwali music tends to begin gently and builds steadily to a very high energy level...</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/brkic-sulejman/" target="_blank">Brkic Sulejman</a></strong>

“<em>The heavens were within me... I didn’t realize it until I fell among the stars</em>.” ~ <em>From Bosnia</em>

This piece is addressed mainly to peoples in the G8 where there is such apathy and such mal de vivre, malaise if you like, that it makes Prozac depressed. And here in Japan it’s so bad that you end up feeling special.

Capitalism is a political, economic, cultural system in which a small group of people have good lives at the expense of the rest of us. It is a system (ruthlessly promoted by the G8 countries) that will destroy you, me, trees, fish, animals, water, air for the sake of profit.

Or, picture a leech if you will.

One of the strengths of capitalism lies in its ability to isolate us from each other. Although we may be a “society”, a group, and operating with a herd mentality, we are alone and lonely.

Some of capitalism’s main products are emptiness (all encompassing and bottomless emptiness), alienation, despair and hopelessness. By forcing us, through all kinds of fears and with lollipops, to work like slaves at jobs that most of us don’t like, it manages to steal our physical and mental strength which contain our imagination, our dreams, our desires, our hope... After that it (capitalism) repackages them and sells them back to us and we in turn try to fill the emptiness that capitalism has created in the first place in our lives by buying back stolen pieces of ourselves devoid of their essence, of us... empty... so that we will never feel full and will keep shopping.

Needless to say that at the end of the day all we are left with is a pile of garbage and more emptiness (in Japan there are more than 30 000 suicides a year. Those are not happy people who kill themselves. What’s the cause?).

So far, all this sounds a bit gloomy but here comes the merry part.

A few weeks ago I watched a terrific, very radical documentary about fighting back capitalism, bringing it down, called <em>END:CIV Resist or Die</em> (it is dynamite!) by Franklin Lopez and there is one very short scene, full screen, that says: “F*CK PATIENCE!”...

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3hx-G1uhRqA" frameborder="0" width="500" height="284"></iframe>

&lt;iframe width="500" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3hx-G1uhRqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

...but before watching this, and in order to appreciate it more, you should see <em>INSIDE JOB</em> by Charles H. Ferguson in which our rich and powerful make you feel really stupid, weak and pathetic:

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XiGJ3uS4lww" frameborder="0" width="500" height="369"></iframe>

&lt;iframe width="500" height="369" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/XiGJ3uS4lww" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Earlier, I mentioned hopelessness as one of capitalism’s main products. Well, not quite... there is hope... hope for a better world, better lives, our lives.

Hope lies in rebellion.

In his book <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rebel_%28book%29" target="_blank">The Rebel</a></em>, Albert Camus says that rebellion stems from loss of patience and it is defined by all or nothing, everyone or no one.
Have we been patient enough? I am afraid that if we wait a bit longer, we’ll fall into a coma.

If we think of hope as something outside, external to us, then yes, it’s hopeless…in that sense, hope is the private property of capitalism. But if each of us thinks of oneself as a seed of hope, then even the sky is not the limit. In order to bloom, as a seed, we have to plant each into other and water each other. Our feeling of hopelessness is induced by capitalism through cramming our lives with emptiness and based on lack of faith in each other.

“<em>I rebel - therefore I exist.</em>” ~ <em>Camus</em>

This is where art comes in. Now I am not talking about the kind of art locked up in museums or overpriced selfish art in art galleries owned by our capitalist system and detached from our daily lives. What’s the point of that art for someone who can’t even afford a train ticket to go see it or a meal or who’s sleeping in the street? I am talking about the art that is in each and every one of us because I do believe that we are all artists.

The art of creating happiness, well being, good lives through each other, for each other and with each other. The art of reconnecting with people and earth.

We all have intelligence and imagination. Picasso told us once that everything we can imagine is real. Why is it that only a few “make” it as artists? Who decides who is gifted and who is not? The media? The art “collectors”? The State? The artists who “made” it? The art “critics”?

For me art, creating…has always been and should be about connecting with others, making living (not life because life is beautiful but living for lots of people often sucks!) more beautiful, improving living conditions for the wretched of the earth…it should be about us and earth, about social justice.

“<em>I am truly free only when all human beings, men and women, are equally free. The freedom of other men, far from negating or limiting my freedom is, on the contrary, its necessary premise and confirmation</em>.” ~ <em>Mikhail Bakunin</em>

How and when did we fall into such depths of despair and apathy? Apathy so deep that we allow people to go poor, kill themselves by tens of thousands every year, hungry and cold on the corners of our own streets? Well, I think it happened when quite a few of us Fausts sold ourselves (and others, and most of the earth) to our capitalist system, a system that encourages us to be selfish and greedy because, in the words of Gordon Gekko (Wall Street 1), greed is good!

And we did it in exchange for what? A bit more money, comfort and “security”?

So, are we happy now?

But I don’t think it’s too late. Just remember: “All for one, one for all!” by the 3 musketeers. How about 7 billion musketeers?

We don’t need much. According to Banksy (and to some extent Karl Marx) there are 4 basic needs; food, sleep, sex and…revenge! Yes! Revenge! We gotta take it all back from our rich and powerful!

Does anyone have any idea how much damage can be done to a powerful and sophisticated machine by a small tube of super glue? We gotta put an end to the plunder by our capitalist system of our hearts and minds and of the earth. Just like Louis Auguste Blanqui, let us not be too concerned with plans for after bringing down capitalism…we’ll deal with that later.

For all that we need to become artists again. We need art in action for humanity.

“<em>Action is the foundational key to all success</em>.” ~ <em>Picasso</em>

We need creativity. Making Molotov cocktails at home with friends while listening to the Ninth Symphony is art because as Mikhail Bakunin once said, everything will pass and the world will perish but the Ninth Symphony will remain.

That’s right. Art is not only about making something, it’s also about destroying, destroying our monster.

Here is some more Bakunin: “The passion for destruction is also a creative passion”.

One may think that some of these quotes are taken out of context. Damn right! So what?

I am creating a new context for them... it could also be a sort of detournement, just like the Situationists.

Hell, billions of lives of peoples all over the world are taken out of context! Our beautiful earth is taken out of context by our rich and powerful!

So, revenge anyone?

Here is the refrain from the rap end song of <em>END CIV, Get Into It</em> by <em>Test Their Logik</em>:

“<em>Now get into it</em>
<em>Now choose your side</em>
<em>We got to do it,</em>
<em>The time is right</em>
<em>Now get into it</em>
<em>Now change your life</em>
<em>Only you can do it</em>
<em>The time is right</em>”

That’s it. I’m done. I tried to write this piece to the sound of <em>Bolero</em> by M. Ravel and connect it to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qawwali" target="_blank">Qawwali music</a> because that’s how living sounds like to me.

<em>Most pigeon shoots are held in Berks County in southeastern Pennsylvania.</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/brasch/" target="_blank">Walter Brasch</a></strong>

If the first year gross anatomy class at the Penn State Hershey medical school needs spare body parts to study, they can visit the cloak room of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. That’s where most of the legislators left their spines.

The House voted 124–69, Dec. 13, to send an animal welfare bill back to committee, in this case the Gaming Oversight Committee. The bill, SB 71, would have banned simulcasting of greyhound races from other states. Pennsylvania had banned greyhound racing in 2004. Among several of the current bill’s amendments were ones that would also have banned the sale of cat and dog meat, increased penalties for releasing exotic animals, and stopped the cruelty of live pigeon shoots.

It’s the pigeon shoot amendment, sponsored by Rep. John Maher (R-Allegheny), that caused legislators to hide beneath their desks, apparently in fear of the poop from the NRA, which lobbied extensively against ending pigeon shoots. The unrelenting NRA message irrationally claimed that banning pigeon shoots is the first step to banning guns. The NRA even called the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) a radical animal rights group. The House action leaves Pennsylvania as the only state where pretend hunters, most of them from New Jersey and surrounding states where pigeon shoots are illegal, to come to Pennsylvania and kill caged birds launched in front of spectators and the shooters.

Most pigeon shoots are held in Berks County in southeastern Pennsylvania, with one in the nearby suburban Philadelphia area. Scared and undernourished birds are placed into small cages, and then released about 20 yards in front of people with 12-gauge shotguns. Most birds, as many as 5,000 at an all-day shoot, are hit standing on their cages, on the ground, or flying erratically just a few feet from the people who pretend to be sportsmen. Even standing only feet from their kill, the shooters aren’t as good as they think they are. About 70 percent of all birds are wounded, according to Heidi Prescott, HSUS senior vice-president, who for about 25 years has been documenting and leading the effort to pass legislation to finally end pigeon shoots in the state.

Birds that fall outside the shooting club’s property are left to die long and horrible deaths. If the birds are wounded on the killing fields, trapper boys and girls, most in their early teens, some of them younger, grab the birds, wring their necks, stomp on their bodies, or throw them live into barrels to suffocate. There is no food or commercial value of a pigeon killed at one of the shoots.

The lure of pigeon shoots, in addition to what the participants must think is a wanton sense of fulfillment, is gambling, illegal under Pennsylvania law but not enforced by the Pennsylvania State Police.

The International Olympic Committee banned the so-called sport after the 1900 Olympics because of its cruelty to animals. Most hunters, as well as the Pennsylvania Game Commission, say that pigeon shoots aren’t “fair chase hunting.” Almost every daily newspaper in the state and dozens of organizations, from the Council of Churches to the Pennsylvania Bar Association, oppose this form of animal cruelty.

On the floor of the House, Rep. Rosita C. Youngblood (D-Philadelphia), usually a supporter of animal rights issues, spoke out against voting on the bill, and asked other Democrats to go along with her. Youngblood is minority chair of the Gaming Oversight committee.

Youngblood’s chief of staff, Bill Thomas, emphasizes that Youngblood’s only concern was to protect the integrity of the legislative process. Although some members truly believed they voted to recommit the bill for procedural reasons, most members were just simply afraid to vote on the bill. Voting to recommit the bill were 52 Democrats, many of them opposed to pigeon shoots; 35 voted to keep it on the floor for debate. Among Republicans, the vote was 72–34 to send the bill to committee.
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><strong>The Arguments</strong></p>
<em>Germaneness:</em> The Republican leadership had determined that all amendments to bills  in the current legislative session must be germane to the bill. “You can’t hijack a bill,” many in the House, including key Democrats, claimed as the major reason they voted against SB71.

However, the Republicans, with a majority in the House and able to block any bill in committee that didn’t meet their strict political agenda, raised “germaneness” to a level never before seen in the House. For decades, Democrats and Republicans attached completely unrelated amendments to bills. Even during this session, the Republicans, in violation of their own “rules,” attached amendments to allow school vouchers onto several bills, many that had nothing to do with education. But, the Greyhound racing bill was considered under both gambling and animal cruelty concerns. Thus, the amendment to ban pigeon shoots could also be considered to be an animal cruelty amendment and not subject to the Judiciary Committee, where it was likely to die.

<strong></strong><em>Separate bill.</em> Several legislators believed the attempt to stop pigeon shoots should have been its own bill, not tacked onto another bill.

However, only twice have bills about pigeon shoots come to the floor of the House. Most proposed legislation had been buried in committees or blocked by House leadership, both Democrat and Republican, most of whom received support and funding from the NRA, gun owner groups, and their political action committees (PACs). In 1989, the Pennsylvania House had defeated a bill to ban pigeon shoots, 66–126. By 1994, three years after the first large scale protest, the House voted 99–93 in favor of an amendment to ban pigeon shoots, but fell short of the 102 votes needed for passage.

<em>The bill would duplicate or repeal a recently-signed law:</em>

Rep. Curt Schroeder (R-Chester Co.), chair of the Gaming Oversight committee, sponsored the House version of the Senate’s bill. If it was truly an unnecessary bill, he or the leadership could have previously sent it to committee for reworking or killed it. According to sources close to the leadership, despite his concern for animal welfare, Schroeder was not pleased about the amendments tacked onto his bill.

<em>Short time to accomplish much:</em> Several Democrats believed that by spending extraordinary time on the bill, necessary legislation would not be brought to the floor and the Republicans could then blame the Democrats for blocking key legislation.

However, both parties already knew how they would vote for redistricting (the Republicans had gerrymandered the state to protect certain districts), school vouchers, and other proposed legislation. Further, the Republican leadership could have blocked putting the Greyhound bill into the agenda or placed it at the end of other bills. Even on the floor of the House, the leadership could have shut down debate at any time. Thus, the Democrats’ argument about “only four days left” is blunted by the Republicans’ own actions. During 2011, the House met only 54 days when the vote on SB 71 was taken. If the House was so concerned about having only four days left in the year to discuss and vote upon critical issues, it could have added days to the work week or increased hours while in session. Speaker Mike Turzai (R-Allegheny), to his credit, wanted a vote, although he personally opposed the pigeon shoot amendment. “Let’s put this issue to rest,” he told the members. Taking the time to debate the bill, says Bill Thomas, “wasted taxpayer money and time.” However, “the amount of time spent avoiding the bill,” counters Prescott, “wastes far more time and resources than voting on it.”

Nevertheless, no matter what the arguments, sending the bill to committee was a good way to avoid having to deal with a highly controversial issue. It allowed many legislators to pretend to their constituents that they still believe in animal welfare, while avoiding getting blow-back from the NRA or its supporters. Conversely, it allowed many of those who wanted to keep pigeon shoots to avoid a debate and subsequent vote, allowing continued support from pro-gun constituents who accept the NRA non-logic, while not offending constituents who believe in animal welfare.

Whatever their reasons, the failure of the many of the state’s representatives to stand up for their convictions probably caused legislation to ban this form of animal cruelty to be as dead during this session as the pigeons whose necks are wrung by teenagers who finish the kill by people who think they’re sportsmen but are little more than juveniles disguised in the bodies of adults.

[caption id="attachment_17939" align="alignnone" width="480" caption="Boudou: &quot;Credit-rating agencies are a source and transmission of problems.&quot;"]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Amado-Boudou.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17939" title="Amado Boudou" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Amado-Boudou.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="294" /></a>[/caption]

Argentine Economy Minister and Vice-President-elect Amado Boudou charged against credit-rating agencies and accused them of being “a source and transmission of problems,” warning that “as long as they exist, resources will continue to flow from those who have less to those who have more.”

While speaking at a seminar about the current global crisis sponsored by the World Bank and the Economy Ministry, Boudou stated that “previous to the 90s, credit-rating agencies didn’t have the kind of relevance they have today and the financial system still worked they way it should”.

“Some say the economy can be detached from the social sciences, but this is wrong,” he said, adding that “behind the economic philosophy, there’s always the political philosophy, especially when it comes to the decision-making process and that is decisive when it comes to results.”

Boudou assured that “as long as credit-rating agencies exist, resources will continue to flow from those who have less to those who have more. And this diminishes the possibility to create jobs and strengthening the domestic market.”

“When a small percentage of the population holds a large percentage of a country’s wealth, this affects their possibility to generate their own domestic markets and create aggregate demand,” he explained.

Before 2003 in Argentina the supremacy of markets was above government decisions and this unfortunately has become an economic philosophy allegedly undisputable, and “the results -  we experienced them in Argentina and now in Europe”.

However since 2003 making the State prevail is “one of the key reasons why Argentina overcame the crisis in eight years while Europe still can’t find a way out of it,” Boudou said, adding that “isolating economic science from politics only leads to bad results”.

He concluded by considering that “it’s clear that the markets work deficiently, but it’s a pattern that proves that the more deregulation there was, the more deficient they were”.

“Getting rid of the credit-rating agencies is imperative” underlined the Argentine Vice-president elect.

In spite of his elegant words towards sate intervention in the economy, Boudou who graduated in Economics at the National University of Mar del Plata was an active militant of the UCeD centre-right party who was a close of President Carlos Menem in the nineties..

Likewise, the minister was awarded a Masters Degree in Economics by the private institution Argentine Macroeconomic Studies Centre (CEMA), which is well-known in Argentina for its support of neo-liberal and free market policies, and its close links to the ‘infamous’ Chicago School of Economics.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By Gearóid Ó Colmáin</strong>

On November 29th investigative journalist and genocide expert Keith Harmon Snow testified before Spain’s Highest Court (Audencia Nacional) to support the indictments against 40 Rwandan officials for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity during the western-backed invasions of Rwanda and Congo/Zaire by Rwandan president Paul Kagame’s Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) and Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni’s Ugandan People’s Defense Forces (UPDF).

In 2005, the relatives of nine Spanish nationals killed in Rwanda and the Congo in 1994, 1996, 1997 and 2000, filed a lawsuit against the government of Rwanda resulting in the issuing of Interpol international arrest warrants for 40 Rwandan officials of Kagame’s régime.

On 6 February 2008, the Spanish Investigative Judge Andreu Merelles issued an indictment charging 40 current or former high-ranking Rwandan military officials with serious crimes including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and terrorism, perpetrated over a period of 12 years, from 1990 to 2002, against the civilian population, and primarily against members of the Hutu ethnic group.

While the investigations were initially based on complaints from families of nine Spaniards who were killed, harmed or disappeared during the period at issue, the indictment was subsequently expanded to include crimes committed against Rwandan and Congolese victims, based on the universal jurisdiction doctrine. The indictment rules out the prosecution of Paul Kagame, arguing that he may not be prosecuted as long as he holds the position of President of Rwanda.

According to Spanish lawyer <a href="http://www.bpi-icb.com/pdf/Genocides_Rwanda_Congo_ICC_UN_USA_GB_spt_2010_1.pdf" target="_blank">Jordi Palou Loverdos</a>:
<blockquote>Spain’s Audencia Nacional was only met by silence when it duly and formally asked the U.N. to hand over the evidence of these crimes perpetrated against people in 1996 and 1997 or the evidence of the pillaging of valuable mineral resources conducted in these same years or earlier. The international media which had access to the UN report have made public the fact that the UN High Commissioner responsible for the report  keeps- separately from the latter- a confidential  data bank containing evidence that implicates individual Rwandan and Ugandan military officials.</blockquote>
In spite of threats and intimidation from agents linked to Western governments and from the United Nations, the Spanish High Court authorities are continuing to hear evidence against the Ugandan and Rwandan proxy forces of the United States in Africa.

Keith Harmon Snow has been researching the real facts of the tragedy known to the world as the Rwandan genocide since 1994, and has, along with many other experts, evidence to prove that the United States, Britain and Israel were responsible for the training, financing and covert military and logistic support of Kagame and Museveni’s forces.

On 6 April 1994, the UPDF/RPA proxy forces assassinated the Rwandan and Burundian presidents (Juvenal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira), their military chiefs of staff, and the French pilots of the plane they were flying on, thus provoking and participating in the extermination of hundreds of thousands of Hutus and Tutsis in one of the most violent civil wars in modern history.

Snow also presented detailed evidence of the war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed by Kagame and Museveni’s proxy forces, after they invaded the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1996, again backed by the Pentagon, Israel and NATO allies. The Congo/Zaire invasion was commanded by generals Paul Kagame and James Kabarebe, and they involved an officer attached to Kabarebe named Hyppolite Kanambe — alias Joseph Kabila, the strongman in Congo today.

The ongoing Rwandan occupation and plunder of eastern Congo has resulted in the deaths of some ten million people, making this the worst war since the Second World War. The Central African holocaust has been largely ignored by the global mass media corporations who are calling for “humanitarian intervention” in Syria, much as they did to justify invading Libya, by the same countries responsible for supporting mass carnage in Africa.

In spite of orders from Laurent Désire Kabila (Congo’s interim president of 1998-2001), to disengage from the Congo, the RPA and UPDF re-invaded the Congo in 1998, resulting in the Second Congolese War. Although the war is said to have ended in 2001, mass killing of the populations in the mineral rich Kivu provinces of Eastern Congo, under the leadership of these US-backed dictators, has continued to this day.

Contrary to its stated “peacekeeping” mission, the United Nations Observers Mission for the Congo (MONUC) and its follow on dependent, Monusco, has been deployed in the Congo since 2000 and has been involved in sexual violence and contraband activities. MONUC has provided cover for the Rwandan, Ugandan and Burundi forces, USAID, the Pentagon’s new Africa Command (AFRICOM), and scores of Western mining corporations who are plundering the Eastern Congo.

Snow gave detailed testimony to the Audencia Nacional of the American, British, Belgian, German, Israeli and Australian mining corporations who have profited from the Pentagon’s holocaust in the Congo. Banro Corporation, Barrick Gold and many companies run by the Blattner dynasty have profited astronomically from the pillaging of the Congolese people’s resources, as domestic warlords and Western elites enrich themselves while the local people starve.

Snow alleges that these corporations have direct links to the criminal networks run by Paul Kagame, who are plundering the Kivu provinces of the Eastern Congo and massacring the Hutu Rwandan refugees there.

Though the majority of victims have been from the populations of Rwandan Hutus, Rwandan Tutsis and Twa have also been targeted, both in Congo and Rwanda, and many Congolese ethnic groups have been targeted in the Congo. The Kagame regime is determined to eliminate all possible opposition to its rule and to occupy and annex eastern Congo to create a “Republic of the Volcanoes” controlled by Rwanda and populated with satellite US military bases.

Snow told the Spanish court that details collected by the UN Panel of Experts report of 2001 to 2010, detailing the illegal occupation, plunder and war crimes in the Congo, have been watered down by special interest groups linked to Western governments, thus shielding Western corporations and governments from scrutiny by the International Criminal Court and the Criminal Tribunal on Rwanda.

Trained in the notorious Fort Levenworth, Kansas (USA) and advised by former British prime minister Tony Blair, Paul Kagame is without question one of the most evil dictators in modern history. The scale and intensity of his atrocities dwarf those of Pinochet, Suharto and Somoza combined.

In spite of expertise gained on the ground throughout Central Africa spanning 20 years, expert testimony to the US House of Representatives in 2001, extensive work as genocide consultant to the United Nations and numerous meticulously documented reports, Keith Harmon Snow’s work continues to be ignored by the corporate media and many outlets who claim to be ‘progressive’ and ‘independent’.

According to Snow:
<blockquote>U.S.-based groups fronted by the intelligence and defense establishment and pretending to be ‘grass roots non-government organizations’ — such as the ENOUGH project, Raise Hope for Congo, Resolve, STAND and Save Darfur — have co-opted the grass roots movement and are whitewashing the issues and controlling the media, academic and public spaces to prevent the true grass roots voices for Central Africa from being heard and to prevent the deeper issues from being understood.</blockquote>
In preparation for a documentary film to be released next year on the African holocaust, Keith Harmon Snow has just completed a series of interviews with distinguished scholars, investigative journalists and lawyers from France, Spain, Germany, Camaroun and Rwanda. The film, as yet untitled, is expected to be aired in film festivals throughout the world and will also be available online for mass viewing.

Rwanda and the Congo belong to the ninth circle of global capitalism’s Dantesque inferno. It is the circle of betrayal; betrayal of the high ideals of the United Nations to uphold the rule of law and work towards the goal of international peace and stability; betrayal of the trust ordinary citizens of the world have in media corporations to tell them what is really happening in the world, so that leaders and potentates can be held to account.

Uncovering the truth about the role of Western imperialism in the violence that has beset Central Africa since the fall of the USSR to the present day, is of vital importance, as the obscene and racist myth of an African genocide America “failed to prevent” constitutes the mendacious and  insane basis for the Orwellian “responsibility to protect” doctrine.

Western governments and their pro-Kagame lobbies in the mainstream media are quick to smear as ‘genocide deniers’ those who challenge the lies and distortions of the official genocide narrative of the current Rwandan régime by exposing the inconvenient and politically incorrect facts. In the case of Rwanda and the Congo, it should now be abundantly clear who those genocide-deniers are.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've replaced the ‘ in the headline with a ' (curly quote sign with straight quote sign) and I've changed the photo caption from:

"Graves of Rwandan genocide victims"

to:

"Spanish High Court hears evidence from journalist Keith Harmon Snow. Photo: Graves of Rwandan genocide victims."

About the photo caption, maybe I've said this before and maybe I didn't say it clear enough, so I give it another try. :)

If the photo caption only mentions what is in the photo, that of course isn't wrong, but when the article is published at the front page http://www.mathaba.net the text of the photo caption appears as a sub headline under the headline, and therefore, in this case, it would look like:

[headline] Investigating the Pentagon's African Holocaust

[sub headline] Graves of Rwandan genocide victims

which doesn't make much sense.

See for example the article with headline "The imprisonment and mistreatment of Libyan citizen Ahmad Ibrahim by NTC forces" which is at the current front page http://www.mathaba.net. The text below the headline (Intellectual …….. rebels) actually is the photo caption. If the photo caption only would have mentioned what (who) is in the photo, it would have looked like:

[headline] The imprisonment and mistreatment of Libyan citizen Ahmad Ibrahim by NTC forces

[sub headline] Ahmad Ibrahim

To avoid this, best is to not (just) literally mention what/who is in the photo, but make the caption e.g. a very short summary of the article (one or two sentences) or choose an important phrase from the article and use that phrase as photo caption. Something like that. Or, if you only want to mention what/who is in the photo, then make the caption: "Photo: Ahmad Ibrahim" (example). Then it will be clear at the front page that the sub headline is about the photo.

I hope I said this clear now. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

[caption id="attachment_17962" align="alignnone" width="400" caption="Photo: William Waack, da Globo, aparece nos documentos secretos."]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Willian-Waack1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17962" title="Willian Waack[1]" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Willian-Waack1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="280" /></a>[/caption]<em>Aconteceu o que já era de conhecimento dos menos desavisados. A grande imprensa  brasileira foi finalmente desnudada, com tudo comprovado em documentos oficiais e sigilosos. Quem ainda tinha motivos para outorgar credibilidade à estes veículos e seus jornalistas, não tem mais.</em>

Novos documentos vazados pela organização WikiLeaks trazem à tona detalhes e provas da estreita relação do USA com o monopólio dos meios de comunicação no Brasil semicolonial.

Um despacho diplomático de 2005, por exemplo, assinado pelo então cônsul de São Paulo, Patrick Dennis Duddy, narra o encontro em Porto Alegre do então embaixador John Danilovich com representantes do grupo RBS, descrito como "o maior grupo regional de comunicação da América Latina", ligado às organizações Globo.

O encontro é descrito como "um almoço 'off the record' [cujo teor da conversa não pode ser divulgado], e uma nota complementar do despacho diz: "Nós temos tradicionalmente tido acesso e relações excelentes com o grupo".

Outro despacho diplomático datado de 2005 descreve um encontro entre Danilovich e Abraham Goldstein, líder judeu de São Paulo, no qual a conversa girou em torno de uma campanha de imprensa pró-sionista no monopólio da imprensa no Brasil que antecedesse a Cúpula América do Sul-Países Árabes daquele ano, no que o jornalão O Estado de S.Paulo se prontificou a ajudar, prometendo uma cobertura "positiva" para Israel.

Os documentos revelados pelo WikiLeaks mostram ainda que nomes proeminentes do monopólio da imprensa são sistematicamente convocados por diplomatas ianques para lhes passar informações sobre a política partidária e o cenário econômico da semicolônia ou para ouvir recomendações.
_
Um deles é o jornalista William Waack, apresentador de telejornais e de programas de entrevistas das Organizações Globo. Os despachos diplomáticos enviados a Washington pelas representações consulares ianques no Brasil citam três encontros de Waack com emissários da administração do USA. O primeiro deles foi em abril de 2008 (junto com outros jornalistas) com o almirante Philip Cullom, que estava no Brasil para acompanhar exercícios conjuntos entre as marinhas do USA, do Brasil e da Argentina.

O segundo encontro aconteceu em 2009, quando Waack foi chamado para dar informações sobre as conformações das facções partidárias visando o processo eleitoral de 2010. O terceiro foi em 2010, com o atual embaixador ianque, Thomas Shannon, quando o jornalista novamente abasteceu os ianques com informações detalhadas sobre os então candidatos a gerente da semicolônia Brasil.

[caption id="attachment_17963" align="alignright" width="230" caption="Cai também a máscara de Fernando Rodrigues, da Folha"]<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Fernando-Rodrigues-da-Folha.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-17963" title="Fernando Rodrigues, da Folha" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Fernando-Rodrigues-da-Folha.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="170" /></a>[/caption]

Outro nome proeminente muito requisitado pelos ianques é do jornalista Carlos Eduardo Lins da Silva, d'A Folha de S.Paulo. Os documentos revelados pelo WikiLeaks dão conta de quatro participações do jornalista (ou "ex-jornalista e consultor político", como é descrito) em reuniões de brasileiros com representantes da administração ianque: um membro do Departamento de Estado, um senador, o cônsul-geral no Brasil e um secretário para assuntos do hemisfério ocidental. Na pauta, o repasse de informações sobre os partidos eleitoreiros no Brasil e sobre a exploração de petróleo na camada pré-sal.

Cai também a máscara de Fernando Rodrigues, da Folha
Fernando Rodrigues, repórter especial de política da Folha de S.Paulo, chegou a dar explicações aos ianques sobre o funcionamento do Tribunal de Contas da União.

Outro assunto que veio à tona com documentos revelados pelo WikiLeaks são os interesses do imperialismo ianque no estado brasileiro do Piauí.

Um documento datado de 2 de fevereiro de 2010 mostra que representantes do USA participaram de uma conferência organizada pelo governador do Piauí, Wellington Dias (PT), na capital Teresina, a fim de requisitar a implementação de obras de infra-estrutura que poderiam favorecer a exploração pelos monopólios ianques das imensas riquezas em matérias-primas do segundo estado mais pobre do Nordeste.

A representante do WikiLeaks no Brasil, a jornalista Natália Viana, adiantou que a organização divulgará em breve milhares de documentos inéditos da diplomacia ianque sobre o Brasil produzidos durante o gerenciamento Lula, incluindo alguns que desnudam a estreita relação do USA com o treinamento do aparato repressivo do velho Estado brasileiro.

<em>Cesária Évora foi, é e será sempre a voz da África para milhões de pessoas.</em>

<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Director e Chefe de redacção</strong>
<strong> Versão portuguesa</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

Não seria exagero dizer que Cesária Évora foi, é e será sempre a voz da África para milhões de pessoas. De facto, Cesária Évora é património mundial para os países membros da CPLP e constituirá uma eterna mais-valia para o espaço lusófono… porque Cesária Évora é mais do que uma voz, é mais do que um coração e ainda mais do que uma alma.

Há duas palavras que surgem do riquíssimo vocábulo da língua portuguesa para a descrever, e estas duas palavras são Cesária Évora. Definem-na no seu espaço, no seu contexto, colocam-na na Pátria que ela amava e cuja voz de referência ela se tornou. Se cantava de pé descalço foi porque ela sentia a sua terra a percorrer as suas veias, é porque Cabo Verde, primeiro e em segundo lugar, África, é parte integral da sua plasma. Quando pegava num microfone num palco, foi porque dignou-se a enriquecer a cultura mundial com aquele dom com que ela já tinha honrado todos os recantos da sua Ilha, São Vicente, e há muitos anos.

Aos 70 anos de idade, o corpo de Cesária Évora nos deixou no Hospital Baptista de Sousa, ilha de São Vicente, Cabo Verde neste sábado, 17 de dezembro. Mas vai continuar a viver entre nós muito mais do que a voz dela, pois esta era simplesmente um veículo para transmitir seu coração, sua alma e o coração e a alma da África. O que vai continuar a viver entre nós é a melancolia, a nostalgia, o amor correspondido e não, a esperança e o desejo vividos, usufruídos e queimados, a humanidade, a morna, a lágrima, a tristeza e nobreza e alegria ... da África e dos africanos, do Cabo Verde e dos cabo-verdeanos na voz de Cesária Évora, singular, ímpar, digna.

E isso, ninguém nem nada poderá destruir ou tirar de nós, nunca. Esse anjo da cultura mundial, nasceu no Mindelo, Capital da ilha de São Vicente, Cabo Verde em 27 de agosto de 1941, passou os primeiros anos da sua vida cantando e encantando São Vicente com o seu talento, e somente em 1988, aos 47 anos de idade, ela gravou seu primeiro álbum, em Paris.

Cesária Évora saltou para o palco mundial em 1992, aos 50 anos de idade, depois de apresentar seu quarto álbum, Miss Perfumado, em Paris, e depois dos shows subseqüentes, na cidade de Paris Theatre. Seis álbuns tinham referências Grammy, um prêmio que ela ganhou em 2004 (World Music, Voz d'Amor). Onze álbuns são apenas parte do seu legado, sendo o último Nha Sentimento (2009).

Cesária Évora, ou "Cize" para seus amigos, havia nascido em uma família musical - seu pai Justiniano da Cruz tocava cavaquinho, viola e violino, seu irmão tocava saxofone e entre os amigos da família, estava o compositor cabo-verdiano, B. Leza. O instrumento da Cesária Évora, porém, foi sua alma, através da sua voz, e desde tenra idade ela cantou nas ruas, nas praças "para esquecer as coisas tristes" nas suas palavras. Mais tarde acrescentou como palcos abençoados, acariciados e honrados pela sua voz bares, hotéis, salas de concerto. Acrescentaram-se mas nunca substituíram os caminhos, as ruas e as praças que ela pisava sem sapatos, a Rainha da Morna não precisava.

Sua interpretação da canção Sôdade dá asas a qualquer coração ou alma de qualquer geração de qualquer idade em qualquer lugar na Terra. Quem ouve a voz de Cesária Évora ouve uma alma a voar, ouve a história contada de milhares de anos de segredos africanos, ouve o espírito de Cabo Verde, o coração da África, a nobreza da Mulher.

Quão feridos os corações da África, de Cabo Verde, do espaço CPLP hoje. Porém, o legado da Cesária Évora é tornar a tristeza em alegria. E que rico legado é esse…

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18009" title="Sans titre2" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Hamedi_home_destroyed.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="240" />
<em>Khaled K. El-Hamedi lost his pregnant wife and his three young children during a NATO bombing raid on their house on 20 June 2011.</em>

<strong>By Dr. Franklin Lamb</strong>

It was a warm early Monday morning along the Libyan coast on June 20, 2011.

At approximately 0200 GMT the next day in NATO Headquarters in Brussels and 30 minutes later in its media center in Naples, staffers finished tabulating NATO's 92nd day of aerial attacks on Libya and began to post the data on its <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.nato.int" target="_blank">website</a>.

Twenty four hours earlier an Atlantic Alliance command unit, located approximately 30 miles off the Libyan coast, in a direct line with Malta, and NATO's targeting unit had signed off on 49 bombing missions for June 20, the last day of spring and the last day of NATO's original UN bombing mandate.

The authority for NATO's bombing, which far exceeded earlier estimates was claimed from the hastily adopted UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and UNSCR 1973. UN resolutions 1970 &amp; 1973 gave NATO UN Chapter 7 authority to enforce a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace, initially for 90 days which ironically ended the day before its bombing at Sorman.

The two UN Security Council Resolutions were insisted upon by their main sponsors, France, the UK, Italy and the US who claimed that "a limited no-fly zone would protect Libya's civilian population from the wrath of the government of Libya's leader, Muammar Kaddafi." NATO requested and was granted two additional 90 days extensions to continue its Libyan mission which gave its air force until the end of 2011 to continue "Operation Unified Protector".

It was early Monday morning, June 20, 2011.

Sorman, Libya. A quiet and peaceful Libyan town, Sorman is located 45 miles west of Tripoli, near the Mediterranean coast, in the Zawiya District of the Tripolitania region in northwestern Libya. Many of the town’s children grew up exploring the 3rd Century  magnificent Roman ruins at nearby Zabratha. Some archeologists consider Zabratha, located almost in direct line with Rome across the Mediterranean, and built on a high cliff above the sea, as the most complete extant Roman architecture with only a small part of this large Roman city having been excavated. This observer has visited Zabratha a few times since the mid-1980s and each visit elicits more awe. Families from Sorman and nearby villages regularly visit and picnic there.

In the early hours of June 20, 2011 it was dark in Sorman except for some muted half-moon light. A few dim street lights and some partially illumined homes  provided some light as residents began to rise and prepare for the Al Fajr ("Dawn") prayers.

At the homestead of Khaled K. El-Hamedi, the 37 year old President of the International Organization for Peace, Care &amp; Relief (IOPCR), one of Libya's most active social service organizations everyone was asleep following a rambunctious birthday party for his three year old son. The Hamedi family members included Khaled's three year old son Khweldi, five year old daughter Khaleda, his pregnant wife Safa, his aunt Najia, and his six year old niece Salam, among others.

At NATO'’s Control and Command Center, the 49 bombing missions planned for early morning of June 20, included a target at Sorman, which would push the number of NATO reconnaissance sorties over Libya to 11,930. This number would become 26,500 by midnight on October 31, when NATO would end its air campaign. The day's bombing sorties would also bring the tally of rocket and bombing targets to 4,521. This figure would increase to more than 11,781 by late fall, when NATO was instructed to end OUP (Operation Unified Protector).

<strong>NATO prepares to bomb Dorman's "command and control center"</strong>

Before the bombs were fired at Khaled K. al-Hamedi compound, NATO staff conducted a six-step process, the first of which was surveillance using the MQ-9 Reaper UAV, which sometimes is also used to fire missiles. Also above Sorman was a Predator drone with full-motion video. During June 19 and the early hours of June 20, the drones locked on the Hamedi  homestead target and relayed updated information to NATO's command center.

The Hamedi home was not what NATO labels a "time-critical target" so there was plenty of time for its staff to transmit information about the site from unmanned reconnaissance aircraft to intelligence analysts. Almost certainly, according to a source at <em>Jane's Weekly</em>, NATO UAV's watched the Hamedi compound over a period of days and presumably observed part of the birthday party being held for three old Huweldi, the day before the order to bomb was issued.

NATO Rules of Engagement for "Operation United Protector", constitute a set of classified documents which present specific and detailed instructions about what is a legitimate target and who can approve the target, whether pre-planned or "on the fly" when a pilot happens upon a target of opportunity. The Sorman attack on the Hamedi home was planned as part of what NATO calls its "Joint Air Tasking Cycle" (JATC). A target development team put the Hamedi home on the June 20 daily list of targets. The team used a report from NATO intelligence analysts who determined that retired officer Khaled al Huweldi Hamedi, one of the original members of the Gadhafi-led 1969 coup against King Idris in 1969, and a former member of the Al Fatah Revolution's Revolutionary Command Council was living on the property. His assassination had been ordered by NATO because they hoped to weaken the regime in some way even though the senior Hamedi was retired and had no decision making role in Libya.

On June 19, the day before the bombing attack on the Hamedi family at Sorman, NATO was obliged by its own regulations and by the international law of armed conflict to conduct a "potential for collateral damage review" of this mission. There is no evidence that this was every done.

A requested US Congressional NATO Liaison Office review of the Sorman bombing, initially requested from Libya on August 2, was completed in early September 2011 and found no documentary evidence or other indication that anyone in NATO's Target Selection Unit, evaluated, discussed, or even considered the subject of potential civilian casualties at the Hamedi home  in  Sorman.

Following the green light to bomb the Hamedi home, the coordinates were fixed at 32°45'24"N 12°34'18"E . Specific aim points on the Hamedi property were chosen and eight bombs and missiles were readied and attached to the strike aircraft.

At Sorman, NATO used a variety of bombs and missiles including the "bunker busting" BLU-109 (Bomb Live Unit) which is designed to penetrate 18 feet of concrete. NATO also used the American MK series of 500 lb, (MK 81) 1000 lb, (MK-82) and the 2000 lb (MK-84) that Israel used so widely during its 2006 invasion of Lebanon.

Following the inferno at Sorman, NATO denied responsibility but the next day NATO admitted carrying out an air strike somewhere in Sorman but denied that there were civilian deaths even as its drones filmed the scene close up. NATO’s media office in Naples issued a statement claiming "A precision air strike was launched against a high-level command and control node in the Sorman area without collateral damage." NATO spokespersons also told Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that "the facility was a legitimate military target and that all necessary precautions were taken before conducting the strike which minimized any potential risk of causing unnecessary casualties."

The official NATO record of its bombing of Libya for June 20, 2011 reads as follows and remains unchanged:
<blockquote>“Allied Joint Force Command NAPLES, SHAPE, NATO HQ. Over the past 24 hours, NATO has conducted the following activities associated with Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR:

Air Operations Sorties conducted 20 JUNE: 149.

Strike sorties conducted 20 JUNE: 52.

Key Hits:

20 JUNE: In the vicinity of Tripoli: 1 Command &amp; Control Node, 8 Surface-To-Air Missile Launchers,  1 Surface-To-Air Missile Transport Vehicle.  In the vicinity of Misratah: 3 Truck-Mounted Guns, 2 Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns, 1 Tank. In the vicinity of Tarhunah: 1 Military Equipment Storage Facility. In the vicinity of Al-Khums: 1 Military Vehicle Storage Facility. In the vicinity of Zintan: 1 Rocket Launcher.”</blockquote>
Oddly, NATO records for June 20 as well as subsequent reports of bombing attacks listed for June 20th and June 21st in its daily logs have never included the bombing attack on Sorman or the attack on the Al-Hamedi residence which indisputably killed 15 civilians.

Just before the bombs hit, eye witnesses,  reported seeing red specks in the sky and then flashes of intense light, immediately followed by thunderous ear splitting blasts as eight American bombs and rockets pulverized their neighbor’s homestead.

In an instant Khaled El-Hamedi’s family was dead. The children were crushed,   blown apart or shredded into pieces, along with friends and extended family members who had slept overnight.

Khaled was working late, attending meetings with displaced Libyans driven from their homes and urgently in need of IOPCR help. As he returned home, Khaled saw from his car window the sky light up and heard exploding bombs. He was frozen in horror as entered his property and observed rescue workers frantically digging and futilely trying to move the thick concrete slabs of his home hoping against hope that they would miraculously find survivors.

Libyan Jamahiriya goverment spokesman Mousa Ibrahim announced the death of 15 people, including three children, were killed at Sorman. He slammed the NATO bombing as a "cowardly terrorist act which cannot be justified." Investigators, who visited Sabratha hospital 10 kilometers from Sorman, saw nine bodies, including three young children. They also saw body parts including a child’s head.

For those who visited the Al-Hamidi family compound  following the NATO bombings, as this observer did less than a week after the crime as part of an international delegation, the scene was one of total devastation. Collapsed and blown apart concrete and tiled homes, small body parts, and bits of family belongings and memorabilia, trees, some blown over, others bending and nearly denuded of their foliage, dead, terrified and dying petting zoo animals, including exotic birds, ostrich, deer, small animals and large moose killed or left near death and most in a blind stupor staring blankly from what remained of their shelters while dying of wounds and from trauma.

Outside one of the bombed houses I noticed crushed cartons of spaghetti pasta and cans of tomato sauce, stockpiled for distribution to the needy as part of the work of IOPCR during the summer and in preparation for the coming Holy month of Ramadan observances which includes doing  performing charitable works and individual humanitarian acts.

Under growing pressure from the international community including NATO member states, NATO HQ claimed equipment malfunction, missed target, poor intelligence and pilot errors.  Finally US Defense secretaries Gates and his replacement, Leon Panetta admitted that NATO lacked effective intelligence on the ground to identify military targets with certainty. Former Defense Secretary Gates, in criticizing NATO’s operation in Libya implied that NATO used a <em>bomb first ask questions later</em> paradigm in Libya.  And this appears to have been the case. These excuses in no way absolve NATO and its 28 NATO member states of responsibility.

Canadian Lieutenant General Charles Bouchard insists to this day that only Libya’s military was targeted: "This important strike will greatly degrade Gadhafi regime forces' ability to carry on their barbaric assault against the Libyan people," he told the media from his office in Brussels. The civilian deaths at Sorman came just hours after NATO acknowledged that one of its missiles had gone astray early on Sunday, hitting a residential neighborhood of Tripoli.

At the request of Khaled al-Hamedi, himself being sought by Libya's so-called "new government", and aware that I was going to return to Sorman, I felt honored as I made my way to his loved ones' gravesites on the family homestead where he and I first met, in order to deliver a message from him to his loved ones.

Picking my way through debris in the dark, under the cold and suspicious eyes of a couple of  local militiamen, I stood at the same spot, where on June 27 his family’s freshly dug graves bore witness to what Khaled was describing to our shocked delegation  concerning the details of the horror and hellfire that NATO unleashed upon his family.

Back in June I had moved to the rear of our group as Khaled spoke to us about the loss of his babies, his beauties and his precious pregnant wife. I was embarrassed because for some reason, uncontrollable tears would not stop streaming down my face and, despite averting my eyes, I saw that Khaled noticed. I was touched when this young man, to whom I was a total stranger, came to me and put his arm around my shoulder in comfort. Clearly he understood that each of us can feel the pain of others, even of strangers, as well as connect them with our own losses of loved ones in life.

Later, as I learned more about Khaled's family and saw their most expressive and revealing photos, I came to believe that with respect to the wanton criminal aggression that caused thousands of needless deaths of innocents over the period of nearly nine months, that Najia, Safa, Salam, Khaleda, and Khweldi, and the others slaughtered at Sorman, are forever iconic representatives of all the innocent civilians who were slaughtered in Libya since March 2011.

During my recent visit to Sorman, I stood at the same location as last June. I surveyed the area and then approached the graves of Najia, Safa, Salam, Khaleda, and Khweldi.  In the cold darkness with the piles of rubble still in place it was eerie.

I knelt close, felt a strange source of warmth and looked over my shoulder. I whispered in the silent night that I had a message from your loving Husband, Father, Uncle and Nephew that he asked me to deliver to you.

I read to them the message entrusted to me. And I left a copy in Arabic, pinned to a bouquet of flowers. The message read:
<blockquote>“Please say a very big hello to them and tell them I am coming. Please tell them I won't leave you alone. And I miss each of you so very much. And please write them each a note. Najia, Safa, Salam, Khaleda, and Khweldi. Franklin, tell them, You are my life. You are my love. I miss you very, very much. Life without you is so painful, so hard and completely empty. I won't stay and live away from you. I promise. I'll return and be close to you. Baba will be back. I love you.”</blockquote>
As I made my way back to the main road in search of a taxi, a militiaman stopped me and interrogated me about why I was there, confiscated my camera and ordered me to leave the area at once.

I paused for a moment and looked back toward what had been a loving family home, a petting zoo and bird sanctuary that had delighted the children in this neighborhood.

A little boy and girl, perhaps siblings, maybe six or seven years old, approached me with their Ethiopian nanny and asked: "Wien, (where is) Khaleda? Wien Khweldi? Metta yargeoun ila Al Bayt? (when will they come home?)"

Unable to speak, I kissed and patted their heads and continued on my way.

Khaled K. Al-Hamedi is strong, deeply religious, and fatalistic. He has pledged to family and friends around the world that he will continue his work with the International Organization for Peace, Care &amp; Relief in spite of the life shattering loss of his loved ones. An honorable family, a peaceful and welcoming town, a devastated country, and a shocked and angry international community demand justice from those who sent "Unified Protector" and NATO’s no-fly zone to destroy Libya in order to "protect the civilian population."

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-18026" title="iran-us-drone" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/iran-us-drone1-500x281.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" />
<em>RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft was downed by Iran's armed forces in the east of the country on December 4, 2011.</em>

A report says that Iran not only cracked communications system of the RQ-170 stealth drone and forced it to land inside the country, but also broke into CIA's secret drone command center.

According to an article published by DEBKAfile military intelligence website, Iranians not only unlocked the Sentinel's secret software but also penetrated the command and control center running the drones from CIA Headquarters at Langley in McClean, Virginia. They then delved into the satellite connection between Langley and the drone.

The article pointed out that Iranian electronic experts subsequently reprogrammed the directives guiding the satellite and the RQ-170 stealth drone by falsifying the images appearing on the screens at Langley.

The drone misrepresented as complying with its original programming although it had been commandeered by Iran and was obeying its new masters.

The CIA handlers of the RQ-170 Sentinel drone did not activate the aircraft's self-destruct mechanism because they were not aware it was out of their control.

By the time it was discovered, it was too late; since the mechanism along with the rest of the drone's systems had been disconnected and passed to Iranian controllers.

The capture of the RQ-170 stealth drone by Iranian Army's electronic warfare unit occurred as the advanced US-built reconnaissance was on its very first mission over Iran. Its seizure at the moment means that Iranians were alerted in advance about the precise moment of its secret arrival.

On December 4, Iran downed with minimum damage the US RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft which was flying over the eastern city of Kashmar, some 225km (140 miles) from the Afghan border.

Iran announced that it would carry out reverse engineering on the captured RQ-170 Sentinel stealth aircraft, which is also known as the Beast of Kandahar, and is similar in design to a US Air Force B-2 stealth bomber.

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced on December 12 that Washington has submitted a formal request to Tehran to ask for the return of the captured drone.

Following the formal US request, Iran's Defense Minister Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi, said one day later that the aircraft would remain in the country's possession as it is the asset of the Islamic Republic.

Tehran says that the US drone spy mission was a “hostile act,” and has lodged a complaint with the United Nations over the violation of its air sovereignty by the reconnaissance aircraft.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/david-stephen/" target="_blank">David Stephen</a></strong>

<a href="http://trpns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Geoengineering-The-Ozone-Layer.pptx">Ozone Layer Geoengineering</a> (or OLG for short) can be defined as an experiment that replaces lost ozone molecules at depleted parts of stratospheric ozone layer by injecting oxygen gas using aircrafts. Injected oxygen joins naturally existing ones in similar reaction to become ozone; this reaction is responsible to protect the earth from penetration of harmful Ultra Violet (UV) radiations.

The stratosphere is a layer of the earth’s upper atmosphere around 9 – 21 miles above sea level, it houses the ozone layer responsible to protect man and the environment from harmful UV rays. A large depleted part of the ozone layer mostly observed over Antarctica is known as the ozone hole.

<a href="http://stephaz.webs.com/ozoneholerecovery.htm">Ozone Layer Geoengineering</a> is a developing research work and has the chunk of potency required to save the ozone layer from depletion  ̶  if we artificially need to. OLG is very simple, very achievable, largely sustainable and less risky. Aircraft to convey the oxygen tank will be unmanned, oxygen will be systematically discharged to avoid Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) from eating it up on becoming ozone and the procedure will not result in excesses at the ozone layer because lost molecules are ‘replaced’.

Geoengineering or purposeful altering of the earth climate system is sought as band aid for excesses of global warming to prevent or reduce their effects; its major types are Carbon Dioxide Removal, CDR and Solar Radiation Management, SRM. Weather modification procedures and Ozone Layer Geoengineering are closely aligning
with geoengineering for now.

CDR is seen as the <a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/theres-more-than-one-way-to-capture-carbon-4483">surest</a> aspect of geoengineering since carbon is captured from entering the atmosphere and sunk deep by storing at sea depths or geological formations. There have been several experiments, some are ongoing and will be continuously deployed this decade and beyond.

SRM is controversial since most of its major experiment is space based and has the potential to degenerate to some unforeseen challenges when deployed. Aerosol-injecting SRM, roof whitening and cloud seeding may however not be ripe for deployment until early next decade if the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/durban-pact-at-least-creates-climate-for-a-binding-deal-20111211-1opse.html">hope</a> placed on enacting a binding deal to curb greenhouse emissions for all nations fail.

<a href="http://trpns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Ozone-Hole-Repair.pdf">Ozone Layer Geoengineering</a> use within this decade has a minute chance but looks like something that might be needed within the first half of this century. Geoengineering many admit is risky but risks lie some way with every option to manage and sustain the earth climate system. Geoengineering is an <a href="http://www.groundreport.com/World/Climate-Change-geoengineering-an-option-not-a-solu/2942644">option</a> not solution to the earth’s climate problems; on deployment it will go within a safe range.

The points below present five reasons Ozone Layer Geoengineering is a valid solution to the problem of ozone depletion in most parts of the earth’s atmosphere over any region:
<ul>
	<li>Ozone Layer Geoengineering is coming because of the shifts observed in ozone depletion perennially in Antarctica and in Arctic of late. These shifts as a major depletion may also come over a region with human inhabitants. The OLG will help to replace lost ozone molecules by providing oxygen needed to become ozone in the ozone layer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>OLG submits that oxygen is discharged to the ozone hole. Oxygen is a major component of reactions in the ozone layer; it is part of a process that forms ozone molecules. An artificial input of oxygen will have it join that process and become ozone that protects. Injecting ozone is not possible as technical difficulties exist with it, and it may not protect since it is not from that process or it may be eaten up by ODSs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>OLG involves oxygen that will be carried as liquid from Planet Earth and discharged as gas in the stratosphere. More volume of the same mass of oxygen can be carried as liquid than as gas; this presents a comparative advantage and is also similar to the use of oxygen in rocket engines. The tank will have a vaporization chamber where the liquid oxygen will vaporize and pass through a hull to the outside.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Aircrafts will respectively convey an oxygen tank to the stratosphere. An airship or an unmanned aircraft will do. These fly-objects have been used previously for related objective and have the potential to be used for the OLG experiment desirably and will return safely.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>The OLG research is not urgent for execution but review is necessary to correct all of its section to prepare it for future use. The research is also not risky as replacement to lost gas molecules is sought. Ethical and political fears for this research are less since there will be a governance initiative for the research to oversee use over regions. Tests and models for it can come in Arctic and Antarctica.</li>
</ul>
Ozone Layer Geoengineering research is one that holds much opportunity for man to see ozone layer depletion as less of a threat. Some geoengineering solutions depend on the ozone layer and ozone layer recovery also <a href="http://www.livescience.com/17347-climate-success-montreal-protocol-ozone.html">depends</a> on greenhouse gas emissions.

Tomorrow is here and today is an opportunity, as knowledge magnifies the OLG procedure closely; ways to flagellate it towards solutions should be sought to prepare us and get us ready for the unseen.

		<title>Señor Moreno-Ocampo, are you serious?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey</strong>
<strong> Pravda.Ru</strong>

Quite how the ICC Chief Prosecutor, Luis Moreno-Ocampo, who has not won a single case in eight long years, does not choke on his words as he speaks of “international law” is beyond logic. In fact, when we examine his words, we understand why and question what his credentials are, apart from friendship with certain US agencies.

Speaking at the tenth session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC, Moreno-Ocampo had the audacity to speak of “a new global order based on law”, when he made declarations about Muammar al-Qathafi, Saif al-Islam al-Qathafi and Abdullah al-Sanussi, saying, and I quote: “We need to issue the arrest warrant…that will stop the crimes, that will stop the rapes”.

Well no wonder he hasn’t won a case. Let us face it, what “lawyer” would still be in a job if he had not won a single case in eight years? Only someone protected and with ties. Let us now investigate what ties Mr. Moreno-Ocampo has, and to whom. So what authority has Moreno-Ocampo to speak about justice, when he witnessed the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya being assailed by NATO and the terrorists it has unleashed and sat back saying nothing?

Where are his arrest warrants for those who murdered? Where are his arrest warrants for those who committed acts of torture? Where are his arrest warrants for those who committed rape, not those falsely accused of such because some Viagra pills were found trampled underground (you don’t stamp on them, you swallow them) and because some condoms were found in their packets (you don’t leave it in the packet, now do you?) but that detested and detestable scourge that ransacked Libya’s cities raping women and girls?

Where are his arrest warrants for those who committed acts of arson? Where are his arrest warrants for those who slit the throats of Negroes in the streets? Where are his arrest warrants for the thugs that carried out ethnic cleansing? Where are his arrest warrants for those who attacked and killed children? Where are his arrest warrants for the thieves who pillaged and looted and burgled homes?

In fact, Señor Moreno-Ocampo has not issued one single arrest warrant for any of these demonic crimes in Libya and there he is - talking about the law? Since the greatest travesty of justice is the ICC at The Hague, and apparently its Chief Prosecutor, perhaps the first step would be to dismantle this living joke, this insult to the precept of international law and replace it with a proper organism which used the same set of weights and measures for all?]]></content:encoded>

<em>How to take back the world for the 99 percent - step one: Truth awareness.</em>

<strong>By Viedoklis</strong>

Previously I <a href="http://mathaba.net/news/?x=629537" target="_blank">described</a> on what directions we should be working in order to stop NWO from happening and actually implement such a society as we want and deserve without elites. In this article I'll try to point out those tasks that we should do in order to spread truth awareness. Before we go to practical tasks of spreading truth you should know how to get one.

Trust no one, check yourself. Before you start spreading truth you should know what it is. You can't trust anyone except yourself - what you can do is receive different kind of information from different kind of sources but don't ever accept it automatically as truth (even me or anyone else). Put it in you mind at a special waiting room for processing, analysis &amp; approval. You should look for its opposite and look at those arguments to make your own decision about what's truth and what's lies - if you can't find arguments than let your consciousness decide it.

Your consciousness is your Supreme Court - your brain may not like its judgment and start to figure out other options, but whenever your brain goes in conflict to your consciousness - you should follow only consciousness because it can't be manipulated by anyone in this universe - it's sacred and will always belong to and work for you. Don't follow anyone as your leader that is truth and God for everything. Don't trust mind when there is consciousness supremacy - if it feels wrong it's not right.

When ever there is truth in your hands you should spread it all around the world - there are no stupid people - only those who lack information. We all were missing truth some time ago so it's our job to spread it in order to awaken others.

So you should:

<strong>1.) Comment / tweet in social media. </strong>

Work in social (<a href="https://social.mathaba.net/" target="_blank">Diaspora</a>, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) and electronic media (local news agencies, <a href="http://www.mathaba.com" target="_blank">Mathaba</a>, RT, Telegraph, Guardian, Reuters, CNN, Daily Mail, etc.) networks to spread information in your native language and English (which is of course the international language).  You should contact not only those that are aware of truth, which is of course much easier and pleasant, but actually step in there where it's full of people that are opposing truth. Because who else will show them truth if not those that have come to it? Don't be upset if you are being ridiculed and  humiliated by words. They are either PSYOPS agents who are there to work spreading lie propaganda and so it's their job to attack the truth (remember it's war on peoples minds) or they are people that have lived in only lies and propaganda and can't accept truth at first sight - you can't free individuals from lies-prisons with a single battle - it takes time.

Remember you can't be wrong if you are with your consciousness - no words can ever injure it. Only your ego can be injured and then it bleeds and you feel down because your ego is hurt. When your ego rules over your consciousness you feel angry whenever you are being attacked - you should not feel that way. You should feel angry whenever you see injustice - that's what should make you angry and lead you to fight against it - that is our natural instinct.

<strong>2.) Write your own blog / create your own YouTube movies.</strong>

When you feel that there is more to tell and give to people than some tweets and comments at article comments sections - you should start to write your own blog / create YouTube movies at your channel and spread your articles/movies around social media. Truth is popular as more and more people are waking up. Do it because you like it, do it because it inspires others, do it because it's creative and it removes all borders - it's your consciousness that tells you to do that - follow it. As more and more you follow your consciousness you will feel more and more happy and there will be fewer borders for you and your false ego will shrink more and more, making you  stronger and more invulnerable.

<strong>3.) Mail your government &amp; make public statements.</strong>

When you are ready to speak out about topics that you feel strongly about, you should mail your government representatives issues re your cares,  letting them know that there are more and more people who actually care about truth and won't let injustice happen without notice. Maybe this message will even wake up some politicians and they will work for truth awareness in the political arena. To make truth stronger and more visible you should organize public meetings where the truth message is spread and people can receive it outside electronic media, and also as numbers grow of people who  stick to truth &amp; show up - truth will get stronger and elites won't be able to easily manipulate the masses or realize their plans. But even if you are the only one who thinks the way you do - don't be afraid to step out of the crowd and follow your consciousness. Mostly people are just following the masses ( search for <a href="http://www.google.com.gh/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=asch%20experiment&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CC0QtwIwAQ&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DiRh5qy09nNw&amp;ei=MMvvTuSlN8nd8gPAkcWNCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEujeSXXM9TfYbEE2Iv1DA9FYnA6Q&amp;cad=rja">the Asch experiment</a> to see how it's proved ) so you should not be one of them.

The good news is - truth can't be bought, changed, destroyed or manipulated - it's there whether elites want it or not - we just have to show it to others.

As I said before - don't trust anyone and don't agree with everything - but these sources are worth of analyzing for good ideas and truth:

		<title>Latin America no Longer for Sale: the New CELAC Poles Apart from the OAS</title>

<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CELAC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18053" title="CELAC" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CELAC.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="259" /></a>
<em>CELAC: a new and meaningful South and Latin American regional economic and cultural cooperation and promotional organization has been launched.</em>

<strong>By Tamara Pearson</strong>

“Haha, Ortega doesn’t know what he’s talking about, neither does Evo, they don’t know anything about crime, there are reports out there that know more,” said a journalist from Bloomberg to his colleague. The journalist was sitting next to me in the press tent set up outside the CELAC plenary sessions in the Patio de Honor of the Bolivarian Militia University of Venezuela. He was watching Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega on one of the various large screens broadcasting the summit live, working at one of 60 laptops provided by the Venezuelan government.

And right there were two things already that made the CELAC different to other regional blocs; inclusiveness- that alternative journalists like us from Venezuealanslysis.com, as well as many others, who normally would have been outside the meeting protesting, were instead involved in it and sitting next to naive and bigoted mainstream journalists such as the man from Bloomberg, and the fact that the whole summit was broadcast live- not just to journalists, but around Venezuela and on the internet. Many Venezuelans at home followed the meeting closely, because unlike the OAS or APEC, they felt that the CELAC summit had to do with them, and that it was important.

<strong>Nothing like the OAS</strong>

“And the president of the United States is more the president of my country / than the president of my country,” wrote Roque Dalton in a poem about the OAS.

Initiated eight months after the coup in Honduras, the absence of the US and Canada, the only countries in the Americas not in the CELAC, is nothing but deliberate. The CELAC is a conscious and collective effort to combat US economic, political, military, and cultural domination in the region.

As Cuban president Raul Castro said on the first day of the summit, “It would be a serious mistake to not recognise that Latin America and the Caribbean have changed, that we can’t be treated as we were in the past. We have had to work hard to confront the burden of colonialism and neo-colonialism, and one can expect a firm regional determination to defend the independence we have reached.”

“The OAS is a ...reflection of the 50s and 60s, when it was an instrument to promote the colonialist policy of Washington...that’s why no one talks about the OAS as something Latin American. It represents the past rather that the future,” wrote James Petras.

During the summit, many heads of state echoed similar sentiments, including the prime minister of Dominica, Roosevelt Skerrit, “CELAC can’t follow in the footsteps of blocs like the OAS and the UN,” he said, and Ortega agreed, “It’s a different Latin America today.”

Many of the heads of state talked about south-south cooperation and regional integration as something necessary, that hadn’t existed in the past. They also talked about solidarity, something that isn’t in the scope of organisations like the OAS.

<a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CELAC-PRESS-TENT.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-18054" title="CELAC PRESS TENT" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/CELAC-PRESS-TENT.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="259" /></a>While following the summit from the press tent, I interviewed Llafrancis Colina, director of Caracas based alternative television station Avila, and Augusto Melero, also with Avila. Molero explained, “The initiative taken by Venezuela for Latin American integration comes at a time when the vision of the world is changing, where there are occupations of Wall Street because the US and Europe haven’t been able to beat their economic crisis. In the CELAC we believe that cooperation will strengthen economic democracy.”

The CELAC’s formally stated objective is to deepen integration and political, social, economic, and cultural unity and to promote sustainable development. That is, rather than a fiesta of free trade deals and luxurious feasts for businessmen or women as is standard fare for regional blocs, CELAC, with the influence of a range of left wing presidents such as Chavez, Morales, and Correa, is about cooperation, social justice, and benefiting the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean.

“This summit has been more humane, there’s a position of respect for people’s self determination,” said Melero.

“In the summit itself, there’s a feeling of camaraderie between the different countries, it goes beyond diplomacy. There’s the feeling that, despite having different political perspectives, the presidents can sit down and arrive at agreements, there’s a real intention to solve problems, to work together. The interests of CELAC go beyond the individual interests of each country. For example, the European Union, it’s just about politics and economy, but here with CELAC there’s a cultural aspect, a social one, it’s not just economic,” Melero explained.

One example of that was the proposal by Rafael Correa at the summit for an inter-American system to defend human rights, without the contradictions, hypocrisy, and imperialist arrogance of human rights “reports” that come out of U.S backed organisations about the rest of the world’s human rights situation.

“For the rights of the weak to have weight in the world, we have to unite, that is the fight, this isn’t a struggle for a utopia, it’s a struggle to be,” said Uruguay’s Jose ‘Pepe’ Mujica.

<strong>Venezuela has prioritised the CELAC and Latin American integration</strong>

The US government with its arrogant and deathly invasions and its paid coup puppeteers offers much less to the cause of Latin American integration than Venezuela does with its social policies and its numerous concrete efforts for Latin American collaboration such as Telesur, the Simon Bolivar satellite, the Radio del Sur, cross continental tourism, petroleum agreements, free eye surgery performed by its doctors in other countries in the region, and so on.

It’s therefore not surprising that it was Venezuela and Chavez who became the president pro tempore of CALC, the predecessor to CELAC, that Venezuela hosted the founding summit on the weekend, and has lead the push to make CELAC real and legitimate.

<strong>“For 12 years since Chavez came into government, we’ve been fighting for Latin American integration</strong>,” Colina from Avila told me, as she sipped Venezuelan coffee.

“The president [Hugo Chavez] has had a political policy of strengthening Venezuela’s relations with other countries, through bilateral agreements, talks, and ALBA and UNASUR,” Melero added.

“It’s an honour for Venezuela [to host the summit]... many talk about the dream of Bolivar [for a united Latin America] but few talk about it as a project, about actually putting it into practice. Today we’re laying down the first stone, a fundamental one for the unity of Latin America and for our real independence,” Chavez said.

The seriousness the Venezuelan government is giving CELAC was evident in the ongoing coverage and debate by its radio, television, and written media, the decoration of Caracas streets and parks with CELAC posters and photos of Latin America, and the high level of organisation of both the summit and for the media.

<strong>Media war comes subtly to CELAC</strong>

In the past, spoilt private media journalists have complained of the mediocre reception and non subservient type facilities in Venezuela. One freelance journalist once commented to me that it was a global standard that any restaurant, hotel, or company treat journalists well (ie free food, stay etc) in order to get a good write up, and that Venezuela was doing itself a disservice by not doing the same, and with its chaotic streets and transport. While I beg to differ on the ethics of that, it was important to the Venezuelan government last weekend that the CELAC was accessible to all media- private, public , and alternative, and it wanted that media to be able to easily cover the summit and thereby help the new organisation gain legitimacy and world wide recognition.

At VA we got a 22-page media guide about five days before the summit, then on the day, made our way in the train to La Rinconada station. In a parking lot nearby a tent was set up where journalists registered, and were taken to the summit. After going through security, we made our way to the press tent, with its free lunch and dinner, coffee, laptops and internet, phones, printers, 16 television monitors, and antennas.

The cooperation between progressive media, and the assistance and information provided by Venezuela’s ministry of communications was special. As Melero told me, “This summit has been premised on inclusion, for example, our media, Avila, an alternative youth station, hasn’t been excluded, we have the same opportunities [access to technology, permission to take photos etc] as other media, we sit next to CNN and talk to them.”

Nevertheless, the mainstream media, in a choir of scepticism, and despite the good hosting by Venezuela, predictably has either boycotted covering the CELAC (Christmas and sports are more important) or has focused on irrelevant angles of it, and purposefully missed the point.

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://mx.reuters.com/article/topNews/idMXN1E7B205U20111204" target="_blank">Reuters</a> dismissed CELAC, saying it was just another bunch of “initials” and criticising it for having “no budget nor a permanent secretary”, writing that “analysts” (who the article doesn’t bother to name) are “sceptical” about the bloc and suggesting that historical differences and different national agendas have always got in the way. Another <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/30/us-venezuela-chavez-idUSTRE7AT23D20111130" target="_blank">Reuters</a> article, this one in English, reduced the importance of CELAC to a “test” of Chavez’s health and wrote (lied) “The CELAC summit will give the theatrical but authoritarian 57-year-old a much-loved opportunity to grandstand at a big event, and bash the United States at the same time.”

<a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.as-coa.org/articles/3825/Latin_American_Leaders_Converge_to_Form_CELAC/" target="_blank">Americas Society</a> also used unnamed “detractors” who “question the usefulness of a potentially redundant forum in a region already plagued by a history of hobbled attempts at integration” and the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204397704577072864178399178.html" target="_blank">Wall Street Journal</a> followed what seems to be a private media trend, quoting more unnamed “analysts” that while the US should note the “latest indication of growing Latin American autonomy”, different strains of government could hamper the Community’s effectiveness.

<strong> “The media</strong> [when writing about Venezuela]<strong> always looks for the negative things, the errors and failures, in this case of the summit</strong>,” Colina said.

“The mainstream media has tried to minimise the impact of CELAC. They aren’t interested in a united block that goes against the interests of US imperialism, they did the same when they invented things that didn’t happen in the Green Square in Libya to justify the killing of Gaddafi, but in this case they are trivialising the CELAC or making it invisible,” Melero added.

<strong>CELAC not just for the suits</strong>

Apart from many people here following CELAC live or in the press and debating its outcomes, there were also other activities in Caracas related to the summit, such as art and museum exhibitions, cinema forums, a food festival including dishes from 16 of the CELAC countries, theatre, poetry, sculpture, and book stalls.

Colina expressed it well, “CELAC is not just about sitting at tables and talking, it’s not just for the government, but for all of us, for Latin America”.

The CELAC didn’t end in a million dollar feast in a five star hotel with 30,000 police outside the hotel arresting and repressing protesters, as is common with other regional blocs. No, it ended in a huge concert in the rain, and the sounds of Venezuela’s youth orchestra united with Calle 13’s hip hop,

<strong>Their words:</strong>

I’m Latin America / A people without legs that walks ...

You can’t buy my life / My land isn’t for sale

Long live Latin America!]]></content:encoded>

<em>The national security state has proven adept at using race, ethnicity and class like battering rams to demolish Constitutional protections</em><strong></strong> <em>like battering rams to demolish Constitutional protections.</em>

<strong>By Glen Ford</strong>

It should have been clear that the United States was on the road to <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.salon.com/2009/05/22/preventive_detention/" target="_blank">preventive detention </a>of U.S. citizens back in 2006, when the federal government went after the so-called Liberty City Seven, Black men from Miami’s poorest ghetto who were charged with plotting terrorist attacks. With unrelenting zeal, the U.S. Justice Department pressed the case that men who were too poor to escape their own devastated neighborhood – some of whom were actually homeless – represented a grave danger to the United States. They were charged with plotting to bring down the Sears Tower, even though only one of them had ever been to Chicago, and none knew anything about explosives.

It took three trials to convict five of the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.google.com.gh/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=liberty%20city%20seven&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CDwQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.miaminewtimes.com%2F2007-11-22%2Fnews%2Fliberty-city-seven-trial-travesty%2F&amp;ei=0E_wTqfmKMjt8QO11O2_AQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGYqpbG9B-B6MwZVqqDM509vVEeBA&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank">Liberty City Seven</a>, who were sent to prison during President Obama’s first year in office. They have since been joined by <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.google.com.gh/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=the%20newburgh%20four&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2011%2Fdec%2F12%2Fnewburgh-four-fbi-entrapment-terror&amp;ei=aVDwTrJVk9LxA4fJsL4B&amp;usg=AFQjCNFBcIVFdbocVhWcvP4Su3Q8s9W7Jg&amp;cad=rja" target="_blank">the Newburgh 4</a> and many others, in prosecutions whose sole purpose has been to establish that there exists an “enemy within” U.S. borders, that it is largely Black as well as Muslim, and which requires a greatly expanded police state with extraordinary powers.

Before one can successfully eviscerate the Constitution in the name of national security, one must first demonstrate to the public that there exists a class of people for whom the new laws are intended, fellow citizens whose presence is such a danger to society that the rule of law as previously understood should no longer apply. Under George Bush and Barack Obama, the FBI has dedicated vast resources to conjuring up the spectre of dark and dangerous internal enemies – with an emphasis on “dark.”

The FBI chose to troll its informants and their fishhooks dangling with money among the poor of the Liberty Citys and Newburgh New Yorks of the nation, creating a profile of the kind of people that the law should not protect. Under both Republicans and Democrats, the national security state has proven adept at using race, ethnicity and class like battering rams to demolish Constitutional protections.

“Once Obama took unto himself the power to assassinate his fellow Americans without trial or charge, preventive detention of citizens became inevitable.”

It is a great historical irony that the election of the First Black President has vastly accelerated the assault on the most elementary rights to due process – rights without which the rule of law simply disappears. A man who looks like the ethnic group that is most opposed to abuses of state power, a constitutional lawyer from the group that has suffered the most from arbitrary imprisonment, is leading the charge towards indefinite preventive detention of U.S. citizens. Barack Obama announced his principled support for preventive detention only a few months into his term, in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=IwjCsBQGozM" target="_blank">spring of 2009</a>. He didn’t specifically include U.S. citizens in his framework of detention, back then, but once Obama took unto himself the power to assassinate his fellow Americans without trial or charge, preventive detention of citizens became inevitable. Obama has crossed a Constitutional Rubicon that would have been beyond the capacity of George Bush or any white Republican.

He is, by these deeds alone, the most effective Evil on the political scene, today. But Obama's nullification of the rule of law was ultimately made possible because this country remains so eager to deny Constitutional protections to Black and poor people, like the Liberty City Seven. Its citizens will sacrifice their own freedoms, just to spite the rights of darker people. And that is how they will lose those freedoms.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The West: A Civilized Barbarian</title>

<em>What the West is doing and saying and telling others to do is beyond the all-too-quickly used term "double standards".</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/brkic-sulejman/" target="_blank">Brkic Sulejman</a></strong>

<em>If you really want to put an end to terrorism, you have to begin by no longer participating in it</em>. ~ Noam Chomsky. Or more sharply: <em>Stop killing their babies</em>, as put by Georgia State law professor Natsu Saito.

Based on the book <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Justice_of_Roosting_Chickens" target="_blank">On the Justice of Roosting Chickens</a></em> by Ward Churchill:

A civilized barbarian, that's what the West reminds me of. For some, this piece may just be about double standards but it’s not. What the West is doing and saying and telling others to do is beyond the all-too-quickly used term "double standards". Well beyond. There is no standard in Western criminal capitalist foreign policy. It's really what G. Bush, the senior criminal, said once: "What we say goes."

I bought the paper today here in Tokyo to see what's going on in the world according to the lackeys in the mass media. It seems that all the evil, the barbarism, the backwardness, the terrorism in the world come from and are located over there, you know… in the Arab world, Africa, Southeast Asia, China, Iran... pretty much anything outside the greedy G8.  And it is all too conveniently situated around oil fields and anything that is coveted by the ravenous West. It's everyday like this. If one is not cautious, one might believe that the West is under siege by barbarians.

A couple of Western leaders, at Sarkozy's invitation, get together and Libya is being bombed at will (to liberate its people… of their oil). In the paper it says that NATO jets blasted Libya's capital. Another article is about Switzerland ordering Assad's assets to be frozen. The Syrian president is also banned from traveling to or through Switzerland, according to government decree. Pathetic little Switzerland! Ha!

Netanyahu, the leader of the only democratic apartheid regime in the Middle East that is holding the whole of the Palestinian population in a prison camp, is treated to standing ovations from U.S. lawmakers for saying that he is ready to make "painful compromises" to achieve historical peace. Painful? I guess for that pathetic little Zionist just pronouncing Palestinian is painful. Insult upon injury upon insult upon injury...

Another piece says: "Watchdog reports Sudan 'war crimes'". But what about Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan?

<em>Silence...</em>

Lars von Trier says that Israel is busting our balls and the West goes into uproar... he is kicked out of Cannes .

U.S. navy SEALS barge into a sovereign country, Pakistan, assassinate a man and leave. In 1989, the USA attacks a sovereign country, Panama, kidnaps its president, kills thousands in the process and leaves. US drones bomb indiscriminately all over Afghanistan killing entire innocent families and nobody is ever held responsible for these crimes, charged, brought to court... Israel rampages through Palestine, sea, land, sky... not even a slap on the wrist.

The West, <em>silence</em>...

Anyone and anything that resists the West's plunder of the rest of our world is put on the terror list made by... the West. Don't you think it'’s getting worse? The impunity is appalling. The West is shameless. And it is all probably due to Western economic decline... the monster has become desperate.

I have to say that the news of the death of Osama Bin Laden made me a bit sad. Although I doubt that we could have sat down to chat over a beer, he made more sense to me that any of the sleazebag Western leaders. His grievances were legitimate. But then, who knows, maybe he is not dead; maybe he is with Elvis...

For fun's sake, can anyone try to imagine the Arab League putting a special force commando team together and sending it to Texas to assassinate G.W. Bush on his ranch? The action would be legitimate at least in this case since the U.S.-U.K.-led war on Iraq, in which more than a million Iraqis have been killed for oil so far, was declared illegal by the former UN chief Kofi Annan.

I'm writing from Japan, near Tokyo, and you all know what happened here in March and is still going on. Personally, I am rejoicing. The Japanese capitalist economy has been badly damaged. We on the Left all want the demise of capitalism, right? Well? To me it doesn't matter how it happens. Hell, I hope it gets worse! Because, to be honest, I am not putting much faith anymore into the organizational skills of the Western Left. I'd rather rely on natural disasters. They are much more radical and serious.

As for Japan, in case you didn't know, this is a fascist country. It has always been on the wrong side of History. Always. It has supported every single US military criminal adventure of plunder (not to mention its History before and during WW2). In the midst of its own recent tragedy -- monster earthquake, monster tsunami and nuclear reactor explosions -- this pathetic little country actually found the time to vote for the UN resolution to bomb Libya. At least this time it could have abstained. That’s when I thought:  "Japan…to the flames!"

And do not send any donations to Japan. They have the money. They have stolen more than enough. Send them to Haiti or Hamas in Gaza instead. That's what I did.

Now you might say I should be careful to separate the people from the government. No, I don’t want to. I do not care. Does the West do that when it goes bombing around the world in pursuit of happiness? Shall we ask the Iraqis, the Afghans, the Palestinians? Shall we talk about the daily "collateral damage"?

Earlier I mentioned indiscriminate Western military terrorism. Don't even get me started on its daily economic and cultural terrorism against anyone or anything daring to resist its greed.

Enough is enough!

So, here is my point loud and clear, from the bottom of my heart, in the words of the late Nazir Qabbani, the poet of love: <em>I am with terrorism of the oppressed!</em>
<blockquote>I am with terrorism
As long as the new world order
Wants to slaughter my offspring
And send them to dogs.
For all this
I raise my voice high:
I am with terrorism
I am with terrorism
I am with terrorism...

<em>Nizar Qabbani</em>
<em> London, 15 Nisan (April) 1997</em>

(<a href="http://salaheddine.tripod.com/nizar_terrorism.html" target="_blank">Link to full poem</a>)</blockquote>
I am with terrorism of the oppressed by the gluttonous West because, as I.R. Sanchez said once, an attack is a test of truth and also a message of hope for all the forgotten in the ghettos of capitalism and the refugee camps.

Now, to the "peace-loving" Westerner and Japanese who might read this piece and find it shocking, outrageous, offensive or just plain stupid and might be tempted to send me a comment: don't bother, I am not interested in arguing, debating with you or anything you have to say - unless you agree with me and the hundreds of millions of the wretched human beings whose sufferings are the pillars of Western comfort.

I am not open to discussion.
I do not agree to disagree.

Hey Westerner and you westernized Japanese, here is a poem that speaks directly to you, especially at the end:
<blockquote><strong>Waiting for the Barbarians</strong>

What are we waiting for, assembled in the forum?

The barbarians are to arrive today.

Why such inaction in the Senate?
Why do the Senators sit and pass no laws?

Because the barbarians are to arrive today.
What laws can the Senators pass anymore?
When the barbarians come they will make the laws.

Why did our Emperor wake up so early,
and sit at the greatest gate of the city,
on the throne, solemn, wearing the crown?

Because the barbarians are to arrive today.
And the Emperor waits to receive
their chief. Indeed he has prepared
to give him a scroll. Therein he inscribed
many titles and names of honor.

Why have our two Consuls and the Praetors come out
today in their red, embroidered togas;
why do they wear amethyst-studded bracelets,
and rings with brilliant, glittering emeralds;
why are they carrying costly canes today,
wonderfully carved with silver and gold?

Because the barbarians are to arrive today,
and such things dazzle the barbarians.

Why don't the worthy orators come as always
to make their speeches, to have their say?

Because the barbarians are to arrive today;
and they get bored with eloquence and orations.

Why all of a sudden this unrest
and confusion. (How solemn the faces have become).
Why are the streets and squares clearing quickly,
and all return to their homes, so deep in thought?

Because night is here but the barbarians have not come.
And some people arrived from the borders,
and said that there are no longer any barbarians.

And now what shall become of us without any barbarians?
Those people were some kind of solution.

<em>Constantine P. Cavafy (1904)</em></blockquote>

<em>For years the Manas air base has been at the centre of a string of allegations revolving around drug-running, terrorism and stage-managed revolutions.</em>

<strong>By James Corbett</strong>

The <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/" target="_blank">Manas Air Base</a>, situated near the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek, Afghanistan, has played a key role in the increasingly important Central Asian region since its inception.
<p align="left">First opened in December 2001 to support the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the Manas Air Base plays host to the US Ninth Air Force and serves primarily as a transit point for US goods and personnel coming and going from Afghanistan.</p>
<p align="left">As part of the so-called <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.npr.org/2011/09/16/140510790/u-s-now-relies-on-alternate-afghan-supply-routes" target="_blank">Northern Distribution Network</a>, a key supply route for NATO troops in Afghanistan that bypasses the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/8919960/Pakistan-permanently-closes-borders-to-Nato-after-air-strike.html" target="_blank">now-blockaded</a> Pakistani borders, Manas continues to be a strategically vital asset for the US. At the same time, the base has also been a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPxjRn3eXyc">point of contention</a> with the locals for years, and the controversy doesn’t seem likely to die down any time soon.</p>
<p align="left">The base’s deep unpopularity with the local Kyrgyz people has been a leverage point for successive administrations in their negotiations with the Americans for the continued use of the facility. Just last month, the newly-elected president of Kyrgyzstan, Almazbek Atambayev, said that his government will once again be <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/01/almazbek-atambayev-us-base_n_1069080.html" target="_blank">seeking the bases closure</a> in time for the United States supposed 2014 pullout from Afghanistan.</p>
<p align="left">But as important as the base is to the Kyrgyz people, the true nature of Manas remains an open question. For years, it has been at the centre of a string of allegations revolving around drug-running, terrorism and stage-managed revolutions.</p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/q6iFtyMNKT8" frameborder="0" width="500" height="284"></iframe>

&lt;iframe width="500" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/q6iFtyMNKT8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
<p align="left">One of the most surprising revelations to emerge from Manas centered around the story of Abdolmalek Rigi, the former leader of the Jundullah terrorist organization who was captured by Iran onboard a flight from the United Arab Emirates to Kyrgyzstan.</p>
<p align="left">Jundullah is a Pakistani tribal militant group that concerns itself with plight of Sunni Muslims in the predominantly Shiite Iran. Despite widely-acknowledged links to al-Qaeda, the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/ex-cia-agent-confirms-us-ties-with-jundullah-1" target="_blank">CIA has been funding</a> the group for years as a proxy force to commit attacks inside Iran, where it is believed to have killed and injured over 500 civilians since 2003.</p>
<p align="left">As Rigi himself <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOCa70tkggg">told his Iranian captors</a>, his story included the air base at Manas, which he claims the US uses to conduct covert meetings with people like himself.</p>
<p align="left">Last year, Global Research Associate Peter Dale Scott wrote a <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=20126" target="_blank">lengthy article</a> outlining how US intervention in Kyrgyzstan in the name of protecting its strategic air base, has led to the destabilization of Kyrgyz politics and to a drastic increase in the flow of drugs through the country.</p>
<p align="left">In 2005, Kyrgyzstan’s own colour revolution, the so-called Tulip Revolution, brought Kurmanbek Bakiyev into power. According to Kyrgyz political commentators, the entire Bakiyev family was <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2010/07/18/another-%E2%80%98viable%E2%80%99-candidate-bites-the-dust-%E2%80%A6/" target="_blank">involved in drug trafficking</a>, and they used the opportunity to kill off competing drug lords and consolidate the lucrative business of trafficking Afghan heroin. In October 2009, Bakiyev <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=36013" target="_blank">abolished</a> the Kyrgyz Drug Control Agency and the already steady flow of narcotics in the country continued to increase.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, there has been much speculation about the true nature of the Tulip Revolution itself. Although it did represent a popular uprising against a corrupt and increasingly unpopular leader, this was by far the bloodiest of the colour revolutions, with the new leader coming to power on the backs of over 360 wounded civilians.</p>
<p align="left">The Bakiyev government that stepped in to take over was a highly coordinated, and some say covertly directed, coup faction that left even Edil Baisalov, one of Kyrgyzstan’s premier democracy advocates, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00E1EF63A5B0C708CDDAD0894DD404482" target="_blank">lamenting</a> “Let’s not pretend that what happened here was democratic.”</p>
<p align="left">The timing of the revolution itself was suspiciously fortuitous for the United States, which had enjoyed good relations with Akayev from the time of the opening of the Manas base in 2001 until October 2003, when Akayev allowed the reopening of an old Soviet base in Kant by the Russians in the name of combating terror in neighboring Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Kyrgyzstan was immediately put on the US State Department’s watch list, and aid increased to Kyrgyz opposition groups via a number of American-based NGOs.</p>
Curiously, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,349878,00.html" target="_blank">according to Der Spiegel</a>, Roza Otunbayeva, a Kyrgyz politician who took over the Presidency after Bakiyev himself was ousted in 2010, pledged her support during the time of the Tulip Revolution “to ‘our American friends’ at Freedom House (who donated a printing press in Bishkek to the opposition), and to George Soros, a speculator who previously helped unseat Edward Shevardnadze’s government in Georgia.”

Earlier this week I had the chance to talk to <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.corbettreport.com/interview-438-justin-burke/" target="_blank">Justin Burke</a>, the Managing Editor of the Eppy Award-winning website, <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.eurasianet.org/" target="_blank">Eurasianet</a>, which is funded by the George Soros-founded Open Society Institute, about the allegations that the Tulip revolution was manipulated by outside interests.
<p align="left">Regardless of the nature of the base and its involvement in various covert US military operations in the greater Afghan theatre, it is indisputably a lightning rod for controversy, a point of contention with the Kyrgyz government, and a thorn in the side of Russia, which fears the spread of NATO influence in an area that it has traditionally considered its back yard.</p>
<p align="left">Last week I talked to <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.corbettreport.com/interview-436-rick-rozoff/" target="_blank">Rick Rozoff</a> of <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://rickrozoff.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Stop NATO International</a> about the base and how it will potentially be used in the future. I began by asking him whether he takes the incoming Kyrgyz presidents’ latest threats to close the base seriously given how many times the base’s closure has been talked about in the past.</p>
<p align="left">Ultimately the question of the Manas Air Base, or the Transit Facility at Manas, as the US hopefully renamed it in its latest round of negotiations with the Kyrgyz government, is not a small question about an isolated Central Asian state of questionable democratic abilities. The question is the much greater one of struggle for the region as a whole, and it involves not only the US, but Russia, China, and a host of nations with a toehold in this geostrategically vital section of the globe.</p>
As both a founding member of the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.sectsco.org/EN/" target="_blank">Shanghai Cooperation Organization</a> and a participant in the <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.osce.org/who/83" target="_blank">Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a>, the regional security organization that is seeking to bring together the regional players on contentious matters before the anticipated NATO pullout from Afghanistan in 2014, Kyrgyzstan is straddling a fault line in the tectonics of geopolitics. And like any other fault line, it is an area of danger and uncertainty perhaps best represented by the Manas base itself, which continues to be the focus of scandal, controversy, and potential future conflict in the region.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18087" title="Truth Lies" src="http://pub.mathaba.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Truth-Lies.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />
<em>There are none so blind, as those who will not see...</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/yellow-bird/" target="_blank">Yellow Bird</a></strong>

It appears that the western media are as keen as ever to keep covering up NATO war crimes in Libya, as witnessed by a piece that came out in the New York Times (NYT) on December 17<sup>th</sup>, which attempts to downplay NATO’s murderous bombing rampage over a period of seven months by giving the laughably inaccurate impression, through its misleading and deceptive reporting, that a mere 40-70 Libyan civilians were killed in total throughout the entire bombing campaign.

Let’s take a look at some excerpts from the article itself (with my bold highlights added):

<strong><a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/world/africa/scores-of-unintended-casualties-in-nato-war-in-libya.html?_r=3" target="_blank">In Strikes on Libya by NATO, an Unspoken Civilian Toll</a></strong><em></em>

In the opening paragraph below, it is reluctantly admitted that NATO caused civilian casualties, but the number of victims is immediately downplayed by referring to these casualties as being in the <em>‘scores’</em> (a word meaning here, ‘multiples of 20’) thus already directing the reader’s mind away from the reality that hundreds upon thousands of civilians were actually killed by NATO ordnance raining from the skies.
<blockquote>TRIPOLI, Libya — <a title="More articles about the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/north_atlantic_treaty_organization/index.html?inline=nyt-org" target="_blank">NATO</a>’s seven-month air campaign in Libya, hailed by the alliance and many Libyans for blunting a lethal crackdown by Col. <a title="More articles about Muammar el-Qaddafi." href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/q/muammar_el_qaddafi/index.html?inline=nyt-per" target="_blank">Muammar el-Qaddafi</a> and helping to push him from power, came with an unrecognized toll: <strong>scores</strong> of civilian casualties the alliance has long refused to acknowledge or investigate.</blockquote>
In the third paragraph, the writer refers to <em>“accounts of <strong>dozens </strong>of civilians killed by NATO in many distinct attacks”</em>. Notice the use of the word ‘dozens’ (ie, multiplies of twelve, which has an even smaller numerical value than the earlier-used ‘scores’). <em></em>

And in the fifth paragraph:
<blockquote>In all, at least 40 civilians, and perhaps more than 70, were killed by NATO at these sites, available evidence suggests. While <strong>that total</strong> is not high compared with other conflicts in which Western powers have relied heavily on air power, and less than the exaggerated accounts circulated by the Qaddafi government, it is also not a complete accounting.</blockquote>
Here the author states that 40-70 civilians died in several bombing raids, but then he goes on to imply that this is the <em>total</em> number of civilians killed throughout the NATO air campaign, by craftily referring to this estimate as “<em>that total”. </em>Moreover he goes on to white-wash even that meagre estimate by claiming that it <em>‘is not high compared with other conflicts in which Western powers have relied heavily on air power</em>’. (By this wording he incidentally also reinforces the estimate of 40-70 civilian dead as the final tally). In the meantime he takes the opportunity to make the arrogant and baseless assertion that accounts of civilian casualties circulated by the "Qaddafi government" (meaning "Jamahiriya government") were <em>‘exaggerated’</em> - in case anyone should question the ridiculously small numbers enumerated by NATO’s media puppets. He is forced to admit however that the estimate “<em>is not a complete accounting”</em> - but the damage has already been done and the figure 40-70 is implanted in the mind of the reader, who, unless he or she makes a strenuous effort to find out the truth, is going to swallow this outrageous manipulation of the facts.

We can see from this NYT article that the figure 40-70 has been selected as ‘the magic number’, which will now be repeated <em>ad nauseum</em> in other western news outlets, with the added misfortune that these will quote no doubt only parts of the NYT article. The resulting edited version will make the deception even more comprehensive.

Below is a perfect example of how the NYT story was picked up by UPI and published without any background provided on how the number 40-70 was drawn from just a small selection of admitted bombing sites. The reader is thus left with the impression that only 40-70 died throughout the entire campaign.

<strong><a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/12/18/NATO-airstrike-flaws-killed-Libyans/UPI-37661324227686/" target="_blank">NATO airstrike flaws killed Libyans</a></strong><em></em>

<em>TRIPOLI, Libya, Dec. 18 (UPI) -- The </em><em><a title="NATO" href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.upi.com/topic/NATO/" target="_blank">NATO</a></em><em> </em><em>air campaign in Libya appears to have caused 40-70 civilian deaths despite its surgical precision, The New York Times reported.</em>

We can only hope that the readers of the western mainstream media will eventually come to realise how brazenly they are being manipulated, but as the old saying goes, ‘There are none so blind, as those who will not see…’]]></content:encoded>

<em>Like the Nuremberg trials that took place from 1947 to 1949, we will see a new form of "Nuremberg" style of trial take place once the smoke has cleared from the last bout of warfare that the world has seen.</em>

<strong>By <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/tandreville/" target="_blank">Todd Andrew Melville</a></strong>

I needn't justify my statement in this statement; this statement is merely to put a statement out there stating that there have been 'crimes against humanity' to a whole new level of <em>disgusting</em>.

Illegal occupations of countries, to name one.

Illegal embargoes on countries, to name another.

Illegal financing of known criminals, to name one more.

To name a few items.

Look, friends, these statements are vague in their initial acknowledgement, however, once the truth of this statement comes out over the next few years, You will look back on December 10th, 2011, where Todd Andrew Melville made this statement, and then say, "He said it, but, it wasn't just Todd that said it, it has been many people that have said that Those Criminals Will Come To Justice".

From corporations such as The Bank Of International Settlements (BIS), and The Chase Manhattan Bank, to The Bank Of England. These, to name a few, are some on the list that have been charged in International Courts already; the lists that are amassing will shock You.

I make this statement to call out the scoundrels out there, and those that profit from war; hear this, Your time is coming to an end where you reap massive benefits by the suffering of others; the suffering of the innocent, and the willing, and to use the willing to do your will.

Take this how you will, friends, comment as you desire, but know that these words come from a foundation of Love and Peace, and a coming of a New World Order that will see an end to violence in the most heinous of forms.

Arbitrary negativity for the sake of its action, will be done. It will draw to a close.

Believe it, or Not, the choice is yours, and I will not be able to change your thoughts.

Do your own research; know this, it is readily available; you just have to know what it is that you are looking for.

If you agree, please share this post, copy and paste, tag your profile to it, whatever you will to show your solidarity to this statement and that the world will call out the profiteers of violence, and they will be drawn to justice.

As it is said that history repeats itself, it will not come as a surprise that the profiteers of war have not actually been put to justice; those that have been put to justice have been the face of the time. The face of the time, otherwise known as a patsy; or the person that has been blamed and received justice. It is easy to find someone to do something foolish when they have nothing to lose, the tactics of countries using citizens that are poor to join the military; this tactic is common.

Also, let it be known that The Militaries of the World are being manipulated to do the will of the few; this is the true protest for <em>The 99%</em>. However, the true meaning of the protest is being camouflaged by the actions of the ignorant. The protest against this supposed 1% is because they have control over the masses; this is known material from many sources, disagree if you desire, however this is your ignorance coming through; let this knowledge be known to you because you know it to be true; You Are Being Used by powers beyond your knowledge, they have taken control of many levels of government and have infected our communities through corporations by ways of purchasing lands, and utility companies; also in the form of stores and restaurants that we frequent.  The willing have put them into positions of operating these companies, because, well, because we need jobs/occupations to stay alive.

Again, it is easy to find willing people to do the will of the few, when they have the pull; in this case, <em>The Pull </em>is access to $$$ to pay people off. The true value of human life will come to reality over the next couple of years, into the year 2013, after The New Age comes upon us; 2012 is a real thing.

How do I know this? Because I believe it.  I choose to believe that our world is emerging from a pattern of self-destruction; this self-destruction, too, is evident in many ways.  People have been separated from truth for so long, that they are deluding themselves to believe that money = happiness.  Happiness comes first, and money comes with doing your own will, not the will of another.

People, for the most part, are not exercising their minds or their bodies; they are watching television, playing video games, holding their phones, hurrying to get work done for somebody else, or arguing with loved ones over arbitrary pettiness that gets in Your way.  We blame others for our own problems; we lack the ability to accept responsibility, and are willing to find someone else to assume responsibility; one way of this would be through insurance and the process of suing someone for something. We install security measures in playgrounds because we are afraid that our children will hurt themselves, and the schools are afraid that they will be sued. When I was a child, concrete culverts and old tractor tires were an acceptable playground; now we have sponge-type material, that I find hurts if you fall on because it has a high-friction rate, while when we used sand, it moved and was very pliable; however, the thought is that sand is a toilet for night-time creatures.

We worry far too much about things that we needn't worry about; yet in the time we have grown into, this worry becomes very-much relevant, because it has been shown to us that it is something to worry about; what is it that we are worrying about?

We have installed security features at borders to protect ourselves from so-called terrorists; yet these terrorists have been proven, in many cases, to be hired by domestic security firms. False Flag Terror, is a term that is used, for instance, lets use the reference of The Gulf Of Tonkin, when the <strong>USS <em>Maddox</em></strong><strong> Incident </strong>was attacked; it was this attack that fully mobilized the U.S. Military into war with Vietnam, this attack was later shown to have been an attack perpetrated by American Secret Service Agents as a way to show the American People that they needed to go to war. These false flag operations have been known to have happened in many cases throughout the years, and most recently it is alleged that 9/11 was a false flag operation perpetrated by "People In The Know", 9/11 has brought us such things as The Patriot Act; that is responsible for costing Canadian and U.S. and Mexican taxpayers billions of dollars in additional Security Spending, as well as removing the rights of travelers as they go between the countries; what with new scanners at borders, and more paranoia.

We worry far too much, yet we have been given much reason to worry over the past generations by the result of the actions that we have seen in the news. The Mainstream news organizations are owned by this supposed 1%, and it is their motivation to keep us away from our goals. Bold statement. True or False, only you will be able to answer that for yourself; my statement is based on my own research and observations; I have been given all the faith to believe that Good People are being Misled by Scum/Parasites/Scoundrels.  How have they been given this ability?

$

It has always been about money. Control of currency, the creation of it and its subsequent distribution.

When People wake up to where money comes from, they will not be happy; especially when they see where their tax dollars are going; on the whole, when our tax dollars are going to pay for this so-called Interest, it is going to private corporations to pay for them having created money for us to use. It will never be paid off, it wasn't designed to be paid off; it is a black hole, a paradox, a gutter with no bottom.  Yet we continue to pay into it; why? Because that's the way it's always been.

It has always been this way because nobody asks real questions; for instance, one of the questions that was asked recently  in one of the Democratic debates in the U.S. was to Hilary Clinton, "Diamond or Pearls?", was the question. Followed by a laugh.

Of course that's cute, of course people want to know if Hilary Clinton likes Diamonds or Pearls, because that's what people want to know because of the paradox.  We have entertainment channels which show us drivel such as the likes of celebrities and their social lives, and it receives much pomp; why is this called entertainment, when entertainers becomes the entertainment?

It is entertainment because people give it attention; people allow it to dominate; in the news, the local news to St. Catharines, during the 'news' part of the news where they are supposed to talk about important things; things such as celebrity marriages/breakups are mentioned, like it's actually important.

As history repeats itself, and people are distracted by utter drivel, nobody is asking questions, and when someone comes forth to ask questions they are a) ignored b) ridiculed c) escorted away... When discussion is closed off, crimes against humanity are allowed to take place.

This article is also about imploring those of you in the Media to step out of your comfort zone and question the rhetoric that you are fed by international news organizations, which, in their essence, are all controlled by a few... The 1%, of course, and it's not just about the 1% of the bankers, or lawyers, or corporate magnates, no, the 1% that I'm talking about are the ones that would get offended by this statement; and, even that isn't accurate, because ordinary people will become offended by this statement, because they believe in the system that exists, even as it lies to them to their face; yet it comes across as being <em>The Most Trusted Name In News</em>, for instance, even though companies such as CNN have been caught in lies (please, again, don't take my word for it, look it up for yourself, the evidence is out there).

As history repeats itself and we are led into war after war after war with "just cause", and more and more young men are led to their death to kill other young men that are led to their deaths as well, this game continues again and again, because history, as is said, repeats itself.

Lets step outside of the bubble for a moment and ask ourselves what is important.

Only You have the power to do this, friends, only You. Your church doesn't have that power, or the religion that it preaches to you, this is the power that only You have. If your church has indoctrinated into your mind that You only have the power to do things through, let's say, Jesus, for instance, then it is lying to You... This is the most difficult part of letting go of a power that holds itself over you, is to say, "Only I Control Me, and only I have the power to choose for myself".

If you disagree with this statement, still, that is okay, please move on with your life, You must be doing everything right.

This statement is to call out the scoundrels of the world, and by your reading it, you will help out merely by reading... and either accepting, or rejecting what I say. Not all people want to be free, some are content with being manipulated, they may not even realize it is happening, but, if you feel good about all aspects about your life, then this portion of the statement isn't talking about You. It is directed at those who are manipulating others.

If you don't understand this statement, that's okay, not all will; some people are old and set in their ways, or they are young, and believe everything to the 't'. Those that do understand this statement will feel empowered by these words, because they will know that they aren't alone, and that there are others out there who are finished with the perpetual lie that has infected humanity for CENTURIES. This is the truth; there has been a lie told to You, whether you accept that or not, you have been lied to; essentially by people that have been lied to as well; yet they have believed it as well, with vigour.

You are done with the lie.  Now what do you do about it?

Whatever You please, so long as your actions do not affect the free will of other people; this is the main principle to humanity. If you stand for justice, do it in a way that protects yourself and your property, your property consists of your mind and soul and body, and the possessions that you have justly accumulated in your life. Remember that the money that you have isn't yours to begin with; again, a difficult concept to apprehend, but once accepted, it's life altering.

Your money, that you earned, that you worked diligently for for however long, isn't yours; it was printed by thieves, it was printed by banks and money lenders that want to own You; they allow you to use their system for the time, however, in the end, they win; why has this been let to happen; mostly, it's convenience, however, in large part it's because we have allowed it to happen; we have allowed money lenders to invade our lives and our governments and most people, especially in government, don't even realize how corrupt it is; however, when they do question it, they are quieted down, and their questions are silenced; however some of these people get their voice out, but when they do; as we saw with John F. Kennedy, they get assassinated.

JFK's last speech, before he was shot, was about dismantling the Military Industrial Complex, this isn't the Military, this is the machine that runs behind the scenes, this is the machine that runs companies such as Halliburton, which profit off of the sale of Military equipment, and rebuilding after war is done; it is an infection that most people don't even know exists, but it affects YOU. Whether you know this or not, it affects You. Your taxes go towards it, not in whole, but in part, but any part is too much to pay for, especially when most of the violence that takes place in the world is transpiring because it's <em>Good For Business</em>.

Well, what are we to do? Protest? That is happening right now in the Occupy Movement, however the media doesn't speak about the real issue, they focus on the hooligans; Now, get this. Those hooligans, in many cases, are hired by that portion of the 1% that wants the revolt to fail. They don't want you to have a voice, they want you to shut the fuck up, to be blunt.

They don't care that you are homeless, they don't care that you are out of a job, they don't care about You; they care about their bottom line.

Again, there are people in the 1% that don't know that; they too are being had, they are being duped just as much as the rest of us, they are the patsies, again, yet they are still being paid off to shut up; because why would you want to rock the boat when you have a million dollar home and 10 cars, and a vacation home...? You don't want to rock it when it's treating You just fine, however, when the shit hits the fan, and reality becomes clear, the true cost of whatever the term 'success' means will come to light.

Now, the term success comes into play in many occasions; there are some who are legitimate, while there are others who are scoundrels. If you have earned your wealth honestly, I am not speaking about You. HOWEVER! If you have earned your wealth knowing that you have been taking advantage of others, I AM speaking DIRECTLY TO YOU.

Justice will come forward, my friends.  Lead a good life, if you have wronged others; seek forgiveness. Like myself, I need to seek forgiveness for actions from my past, one is financial, while the other is personal. I believe there are solutions to problems; yet in the news what we see is revenge for actions. Revenge only begets more revenge, and before long, not-a-one knows when it began... Even if you 'think' you know where it began, if you learned it from history, chances are it's not the truth.

Back to The Nuremberg Trials. We sought justice from those that wronged us, but since then, we have been used and taken advantage of in the most egregious of ways. The previous president to Barack Obama, George Bush Jr. is the son of a previous president, George Bush Sr., George Bush Senior is the son of Prescott Bush; this name may not be familiar to You, however the history books show, clearly, this man's involvement with Adolf Hitler, the leader of Germany during the Second World War; Prescott's involvement was with the banks; he enabled Adolf to obtain monies to fund Adolf's War Machine.

Some may say, "So".  So what.

While others will say, "Yeah! That's Fucked Up!"

You are being lied to! Elections are guided so that the 'proper candidate' wins, or that a candidate from a bipolar party system is made available to You. Red Or Blue, or in Canada, we have Orange, but in The U.S. there are two choices; both are bought and paid for by big business, and the choices they make are not in your best interest. Haven't been for a long while now.

Democracy is broken; so, what to do?

Essentially, nothing, but something.  Boycotting only works to a certain extent, because something needs to take the place of the broken system, so complacency will not work, because that just gives the 1% more power over You. Am I suggesting to You to NOT PAY YOUR TAXES? As fun as it would be to not have the additional money in the account, that probably isn't the way to go about it, yet... Yet. The system will fall, the corrupt aspects of the system WILL FALL; am I calling for a revolution?

No, that will mean that we'd just end up doing it all over again. Revolution... Revolve, turn... What we need to do is EVOLVE.

So, as history repeats itself... Don't let it.

What I am suggesting is a sense of Non-Action. Not complacency, but non-engagement. When your government sends us to war, don't protest by setting up a camp in front of a building; that's not productive, because it gives you negative energy, and it empowers them to get your ass off their front yard, and they WILL call in the police; the police are victims too, so they must be embraced, even the ones that have engaged in violence as well, they have been lied to as well. We all have. This non-action involves action as well, because it involves you becoming involved in your community, even if it's difficult to be involved, it will help out in the end, because this is where the Human Unit gains energy.  We are all one, no matter how different it may seem sometimes, we are all the same, we breath, we bleed, we have beating hearts, and we all feel in some form or another; it is those that care more that will help those that have lost the ability to care; remember, the liars have been lied to as well by this mass-infection, the liars that assist with the infection need to be embraced, not protested, or embargoed; this is, perhaps, one of the most difficult things that People will ever have to do in their lives... Love Their Enemy.

Yes, Love Your Enemy. If you don't have enemies, Great, but know that there are people out there that have enemies, and that action affects You whether you realize that or not; but you can see it readily by turning on the television for 10 minutes and wait for a commercial to come on where You will see starving children in some country who need your help.

Don't send them money! Most of it isn't going to them! That may be a terrible thing to say, but it's true. Especially The United Way. There are good people that work for that corporation, but know this, the outcome isn't to see an end to poverty, that's bad for business. Much as the police don't really want to see peace as well, because it's bad for business as well; again, that doesn't speak for all Peace Officers, this speaks for the general feeling that the system gives off.

It is infected, and we are all victims from it.

Love Thy Enemy, and they will see the light. It's so hard to do, but it works, and through time, we will see peace.

If you don't believe that... You are helping the problem. Case and Point.

If you believe that... You will see peace in this lifetime. Period.

It takes one crazy person for an idea to spread; consider this that crazy person speaking to You. I am crazy, in the sense that I believe peace is possible, while many consider the world a violent place that will never see peace... If that makes me crazy... Then I am crazy.

History will repeat itself if we believe it will, or it will continue until we no longer accept lies in our existence. This document is bold, because it accuses and offers solution.

Energy is free. Free Energy has been kept from People for a long time. The Egyptians knew how to obtain it, and most-recently, Nikola Tesla knew it was free -- but he was driven into exile for believing what he did.

The Internet has the power to help us all out, because it allows the mass-spreading of information at great rates so that even if good ideas are quelled, they will still be able to be obtained by MANY.

It takes belief for the truth to spread.  Believe that you deserve the truth, tell yourself the truth, tell others the truth; even if it hurts at first, but it won't forever, the pain will subside when the truth comes alive.

I challenged the system when I was a young lad, and as a result of that, the educators at my school informed my parents that I should be put on a drug called <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.google.com.gh/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=ritalin&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.drugs.com%2Fritalin.html&amp;ei=mm_xTrGjN4qO8gOYypihAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGaYMlsZCn6R4h81bNkxjrp98o0Bg&amp;cad=rja">Ritalin</a>. This drug would, in effect, sedate me, from asking questions that infuriated egos.

The Ego is the enemy that infects us. It is this, within us all, that allows liars to hold power over the MANY. It's a difficult statement to apprehend, however, once it is observed, the truth will come forward. Go ahead, try challenging an ego and see what happens; don't incite, but indict, to indict means to have evidence. I offer some evidence for my indictment at this time, however the truth is out there for many cases. I have seen sources, and know many that have MANY sources documented.

The conspiracy may very well be the truthiest Truth out there.

Don't just accept information because it has been told to You by someone You trust, ask to see where it came from, and allow the discussion to come forth; if you are assaulted for your questions, it may become clear that someone is lying somewhere; because it is the EGO that gets offended, the truth just is, just.

God Speed.

Love and Passion to You.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Auntie! Yes I restored the autosave and the picture was still in the gallery so it's all back now. :) Good idea about the headline, will think about how to change it best... no need to hurry as there are another 30 articles waiting to get published so unlikely this article all of the sudden will be published next hours. ^^

P.S. I've added a sentence from the article to the headline now, so instead "...As history repeats itself" it's now "As history repeats itself, conspiracy may be the truthiest truth out there", hope the author is ok with that. This is a great article by the way, especially the second part, thanks for writing and posting this. :)]]></wp:comment_content>

I had just finished editing this very long piece when I went off to get a link for 'Ritalin'.  Unfortunately my browser decided to do away with the editing when I Googled and it all vanished.  The piece is quite complicated and so I'll be back to redo it after I sleep for a few hours.  Maybe in front of the headline we could put something like 'Freedom Blog:' or whatever.  I'll leave that up to you.

<em>2.800 mulheres de todo o Brasil, organizamos um Mural com cartazes e fotos de denuncia da invasão da Líbia e dos crimes da OTAN.</em>

<strong>Por <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/mad/" target="_blank">Maria</a></strong>

Queridos amigos,

Durante a 3a. <a href="http://www.mathaba.net/go?http://www.conferenciadasmulheres.com.br/blog/noticias/ceara/protesto-musical-contra-a-lesbofobia/#more-591" target="_blank">Conferência Nacional de Politicas</a> para as mulheres realizada em Brasília, Brasil, de 12 a 15/12/2011, com a presença de 2.800 mulheres de todo o Brasil, organizamos um Mural com cartazes e fotos de denuncia da invasão da Líbia e dos crimes da OTAN.

Colocamos-o em um ponto estratégico do evento, no hall da Convenção, espaço onde aconteciam manifestaçoes de vários tipos, protestos, teatro, musica etc, de forma que o mural teve muita visibilidade e esta presente em varias fotos no site da Conferência.

Também demos duas entrevistas, à "Radio Abraço" de Brasília e à Televisão da Conferência. E estamos publicando em vários blogs do Brasil e da Italia.

Muitas mulheres nem sabiam o que acontece na Líbia mas se interessaram e pediram explicações, deixaram seus endereços eletrônicos para receberem noticias e divulgarem nas suas listas. Mandaremos noticias a todas elas para divulgarmos os fatos e formarmos um Comitê de Solidariedade à Líbia, tentando "furar" o cerco das mentiras e omissões da grande Mídia.

Gostaria que nossos irmãos da Jamahiriya tomassem conhecimento dessa pequena iniciativa feita com amor e admiração pela heróica Resistência Líbia, obrigada.

Viva a Heróica Resistência Verde!

Viva Muammar Kaddafi!

		<title>O objectivo final</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Por <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/goncalvf/" target="_blank">Flávio Gonçalves</a></strong>

Cansa-me um pouco tanto ouvir falar da “crise final do sistema capitalista”, a esmagadora maioria das pessoas não se apercebeu ainda que a actual crise está cá para ficar, é permanente, e não se trata de um abalo ou um erro do sistema capitalista: a actual crise É o capitalismo no seu estado mais puro. O objectivo sempre foi este!

Chocados? Vejamos, o capitalismo tal qual se entende (e que não deve ser confundido com o livre mercado e a livre iniciativa) resume-se a obter o máximo possível de lucro investindo o mínimo possível de capital, uma população faminta e escrava dos empréstimos que efectuou à Banca é a mão-de-obra inesgotável e perpetuamente barata tanto desejada pelo capitalismo selvagem. Os que têm muito, terão cada vez mais, os que ainda pouco têm, encaminham-se para não ter nada e trabalhar toda a vida a troco do dinheiro suficiente para subsistir (para comer, mal, e pagar as contas, entenda-se).

O medo de perder a casa, o carro e a família (sim, porque isto do amor tem que se lhe diga: mal a fome bate à porta, o amor foge pela janela, e é cada um por si) causado pela ausência de emprego fará com que os trabalhadores aceitem perder todos os direitos conquistados deste a Revolução Industrial (não é a primeira vez que o digo), e atenção que esses direitos foram conquistados, em alguns casos a ferros, não foram benevolamente oferecidos por ninguém (salvo nos casos da Itália fascista e da Alemanha nazi, inspirados pelo sindicalismo revolucionário de Sorel, mas tal é omitido da maior parte dos livros de História, e ainda mais da formação sindicalista moderna, quase que exclusivamente entregue aos comunistas de cada país)!

Permitam-me repetir, para ter a certeza que compreendem: esta crise não é uma crise do capitalismo, não é o fim do capitalismo, esta crise É o capitalismo! A sede de ganância da Banca aliada ao grande patronado não podiam estar melhor, ninguém os repreende, não respondem perante ninguém e os nossos governos estão dispostos a capitalizá-los sempre que algo lhes corra mal!]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Por <a href="http://pub.mathaba.net/author/goncalvf/" target="_blank">Flávio Gonçalves</a></strong>

Primeiro de Dezembro, 2011, último ano como feriado nacional: à margem das comemorações oficiais um grupo de monárquicos decide evocar a data (ou o fim desta) reunindo num restaurante típico da capital.

Trata-se de uma nova geração monárquica que tem vindo a ganhar terreno nos últimos dois anos, à margem das reais associações e da aristocracia monárquica das “famílias tradicionais”, dos arrivistas e dos caçadores de títulos que acham que ser monárquico “é chique” e serve, essencialmente, para angariar contactos que lhe permitam aceder a um certo Jet 7, quiçá até a aparecer numa qualquer revista cor-de-rosa.

A nova geração de jovens monárquicos não se preocupa muito com discussões de teor político partidário. Socialistas, sociais-democratas, comunistas, verdes ou populares? Não vamos por aí, o problema é mais profundo: o regime (ou o sistema, dependendo do gosto de cada um). O sonho de um Portugal monárquico, onde o Rei surge como a impoluta figura que tem como principal missão o bem-estar e a protecção do Povo e da Pátria, “um povo livre com um Rei livre”, longe dos interesses obscuros e sectários que actualmente regem as direcções dos partidos que elegem primeiros-ministros e presidentes, que por mais independentes que se proclamem acabam sempre por ficar a dever o favor da nomeação como cabeça de lista, num caso, ou apoio à candidatura, no outro.

A organização foi fruto de uma iniciativa do fórum de juventude afecto ao Instituto da Democracia Portuguesa, uma aposta ganha dado que metade dos presentes era jovem, remetendo para uma interpretação mais literal a minha afirmação inicial de se tratar de “uma nova geração monárquica”, composta essencialmente de estudantes, alguns ainda no ensino secundário, e recém-licenciados. A normalidade é a norma, não fosse pela presença da bandeira monárquica adoptada em 1830, pensar-se-ia tratar-se de um qualquer convívio ou festa de aniversário, afinal, os monárquicos são pessoas normais, portugueses de gema.

O principal desafio? Contrapor o preconceito de que a Monarquia é algo datado, do passado, afinal: muitos países europeus são monarquias e, quanto muito, estão mais desenvolvidos que Portugal!]]></content:encoded>

<em>North Korea's leader has died at age 69 of heart failure on December 17, 2011.</em>

<strong>By Stephen Gowans</strong>

<em>There are a few facts to keep in mind to understand what’s going on in the wake of the death this week of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.</em>

<strong>#1.</strong> US foreign policy vis-a-vis North Korea has always sought to force the latter’s collapse to pave the way for its absorption into the US-dominated South [1] — and did so well before Pyongyang began to work on nuclear weapons. US hostility toward North Korea has never been about nuclear weapons. On the contrary, North Korea’s nuclear weapons are a consequence of US hostility. US hostility, now in its seventh decade, is about what it has always been about: putting an end to what Washington mistakenly calls North Korea’s Marxist-Leninist system (Marxism-Leninism has been replaced by Juche ideology—a home-grown doctrine of self-reliance), its non-market system, and its self-directed economic development [2]. None of these offer much latitude for US profit-making at North Korea’s expense, and hence are singled out for demolition.

<strong>#2.</strong> North Korea only began to seek nuclear weapons after the United States announced in 1993 that it was retargeting some of its strategic nuclear missiles from the former Soviet Union to North Korea. Since then the country has only been able to develop its nuclear capability to a kindergarten level. [3] The plutonium devices it tested in 2006 and 2009 produced only one-tenth the power of the Hiroshima blast. There is no evidence it has miniaturized a warhead to fit atop a missile. And its missile program is plagued by problems. [4]

<strong>#3.</strong> North Korea is a military pipsqueak, whose personnel are deployed in large numbers to agriculture. The military budgets and weapons’ sophistication of its adversaries, the United States, South Korea and Japan, tower over its own. If the Pentagon’s budget is represented by the 6’ 9” basketball player Magic Johnson, North Korea’s military budget is 1”, about the height of a small mouse. South Korea’s is 4.5” and Japan’s 3.9”, multiple times larger than the North’s. [5]

<strong>#4.</strong> North Korea has no more military heft to mount a provocation against the United States than a mouse has to beat Magic Johnson on the basketball court. Nor has it the capability to wage a civil war against its southern compatriots and expect to win. North Korea is not an aggressive threat. “In the Obama analysis,” writes New York Times reporter David Sanger, “the North is receding into what the president’s top strategists have repeatedly called a ‘defensive crouch,’ trying to stave off the world with a barrage of missile and nuclear tests…Constantly on the brink of starvation, its military so broke that it cannot train its pilots, it has no illusions about becoming a great power in Asia. Its main goal is survival.” [6]

<strong>#5.</strong> Because the United States is a military Gargantua compared to North Korea, and South Korea and Japan have better equipped militaries, they can safely stage provocations against the North, forcing Pyongyang into a defense-spending drain of its treasury, bringing closer the realization of the US goal of tipping the country into crisis and possibly collapse. On the other hand, North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party wants to avoid confrontations at all costs, short of surrendering to the demands that it close up shop, and re-open under South Korean management.

<strong>#6. </strong>Provocations, then, are all on the other side. There are few acts more provocative than the United States’ targeting of North Korea with strategic nuclear missiles, nor former US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s warning that the Pentagon could turn North Korea into a charcoal briquette [7]. Six decades of Washington-led economic warfare against the country is equally provocative, and a principal cause of North Korea’s impoverishment. Tens of thousands of US troops are deployed along the North’s southern borders, US warships and nuclear missile-equipped submarines prowl the periphery of its territorial waters, and US warplanes menace its airspace. Pyongyang is only the immediate architect of North Korea’s Songun (military-first) policy. Washington is the ultimate architect. Finally, US and South Korean militaries conduct regular war games exercises, one of which, Ulchi Freedom Guardian, is an exercise in invading North Korea. Who’s provoking whom?

<strong>#7.</strong> Kim Jong Il, the recently deceased North Korean leader–literally depicted in South Korean children’s books as a red devil with horns and fangs [8]–has been equally demonized in the Western mass media for starving his people. It is true that food shortages have plagued the country. But the vilifying Kim obituaries don’t mention why North Koreans are hungry. The answer is sanctions. [9] US foreign policy, like that of the Allied powers in WWI toward Germany, has been to starve its adversary into submission. This isn’t acknowledged, for obvious reasons. First, it would reveal the inhumane lengths to which US foreign policy is prepared to reach to secure its goals. And second, North Korean hunger must be used to discredit public ownership and a central planning as a workable economic model. North Koreans are hungry, the anti-Communist myth goes, because socialism doesn’t work. The truth of the matter is that North Koreans are hungry because Washington has made them so. Not surprisingly, calls by humanitarian groups for the United States to deliver food aid are being brushed aside with a litany of bizarre excuses, the latest being that food aid can’t be delivered because Kim Jong-il’s son, Kim Jong-eun, has succeeded him. [10] Huh? The real reason food aid won’t be delivered is because it would contradict US foreign policy. The United States once considered the death of half a million Iraqi children “worth it”. [11] Its leaders would consider the sanctions-produced demise through starvation of as many North Koreans worth it, as well.

<strong>#8. </strong>The death of Kim Jong-il is a potential boon for US foreign policy. There is a possibility of disorganization within the leadership, and internal conflicts leading to a fraying unity of purpose. Rather than focusing on external threats, the leadership may be divided, and pre-occupied with succession. If so, this is, from the perspective of the United States and South Korea, a pivotal moment—a time when the country may be tipped into collapse. And so, at this moment, who would you expect to unleash a provocation: Pyongyang? Or Washington and Seoul? At the best of times, Pyongyang wants to avoid a fight. At this critical juncture, it absolutely needs to. But the calculus works the other way round for the predators. Now is when North Korea is most vulnerable to predation.

<strong>#9.</strong> Predators never let on that they’re the hunters. Always they portray themselves as seeking to safeguard their security against the multiple threats of a dangerous world. Through guile and cunning, the mouse might just outmanoeuvre Magic Johnson and sink a basket or two. So it is that the United States, South Korea and Japan are said to be on high alert, in case the North Koreans stage another “provocation,” like the sinking of the South Korean corvette Cheonan (for which the evidence of North Korean involvement is laughably thin at best [12]) or another Yeonpyeong Island artillery barrage (which the South set off by firing its own artillery into disputed waters, that, under international customary law, belong to the North. [13])

But as we’ve seen, it makes no sense to expect the scenario of a North Korean-furnished provocation to unfold. The more likely explanation for why US, South Korean and Japanese militaries are on high alert is because now is an ideal time for pressure on Pyongyang to be intensified, and because the triumvirate might be preparing to intervene militarily if conditions become propitious.

<strong>Notes</strong><strong></strong>

[1] New York Times reporter David Sanger (“What ‘engagement’ with Iran and North Korea means,” The New York Times, June 17, 2009) notes that “American presidents have been certain they could … speed (North Korea’s) collapse, since the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.” At the same time, Korea expert Selig S. Harrison has written that “South Korea is once again seeking the collapse of the North and its absorption by the South.” (“What Seoul should do despite the Cheonan”, The Hankyoreh, May 14, 2010.)
[2] According to Dianne E. Rennack, (“North Korea: Economic sanctions”, Congressional Research Service, October 17, 2006) many US sanctions have been imposed on North Korea for reasons listed as either “communism”, “non-market economy” or “communism and market disruption.”
[3] In an article on Newt Gingrich’s fantasies about North Korea or Iran setting off a nuclear device far above US territory in order to unleash an electromagnetic pulse attack, New York Times’ reporter William J. Broad cites a US military expert who characterizes “the nations in question (as being) at the kindergarten stage of developing nuclear arms.” (“Among Gingrich’s passions, a doomsday vision”, The New York Times, December 11, 2011.)

With the exception of the Pentagon’s budget, annual military expenditures were estimated by multiplying a country’s GDP by its military spending as a percentage of GDP, as estimated by the CIA and reported in its World Factbook.
